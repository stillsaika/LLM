0,"Model-turned-jihadist Sharky Jama has reportedly been killed in Syria while fighting with terrorist organisation Islamic State (IS). The Melbourne man's father, Dada Jama, confirmed his death to SBS Radio while tributes to the young man flooded social media. Somali broadcaster Ibrahim Mohamed said he had spoken with the family on Wednesday who told him Sharky had died after being shot. Scroll down for video . Sharky Jama has reported been shot dead in Syria after joining Islamic State on the front lines last year . The jihadist's father had been told by Sharky's friends that the worst had happened. '[Dada] got a text message and he received a phone call from Syria, someone has told him his son has passed away,' Mr Mohamed said. 'Then he said ""I tried his number"", because he has contact with his son. Automatically, it goes to voicemail, that’s what he said, and then he knew that his son is gone.' The Department of Foreign Affairs was unable to confirm Sharky's death as its capacity to do so was 'extremely limited'. A spokesman for the department told Daily Mail Australia consular assistance was no longer available within Syria 'due to the extremely dangerous security situation'. He further added Australians who were involved in overseas conflicts were 'putting their own lives in mortal danger'. 'Any Australians fighting with non-state militia in Syria or Iraq should end their involvement in the conflict now and leave the conflict zone,' the spokesman said. 'Australians are strongly advised not to travel to Syria or Iraq; any Australians in either country should leave immediately.' Sharky was a model-turned-jihadist who was managed by FRM Management and lived in Melbourne . He reportedly fled to Syria with his friend, former La Trobe University student Yusuf Yusuf, to join the terror group . The former model's cousins have taken to Facebook to pay tribute to their much-loved family member. 'To my beautiful cousin, the lessons learnt in your presence where priceless in any capacity the childhood memories we shared invaluable you'll be greatly missed for you where great in every shade of light,' they said. While another relative wrote: 'Rest in peace my handsome lil cousin! All them beautiful memories and time we shared I shall keep dear to my heart. May Allah bless your soul.' His family were informed of his death on Monday and father Dada Jama told SBS Radio he had been told of news via a text message and phone call . His cousins posted tributes to their much-loved relative on social media, saying he was 'beautiful' Before he joined IS, Sharky was a 'budding' model with FRM Management. Reports the Melbourne man of Somalian descent had fled to Syria to join the front lines first surfaced last year. It is believed Sharky and his friend, former La Trobe University student Yusuf Yusuf, had travelled to key IS outposts of Fallujah, Iraq, and Raqqa, Syria, respectively. In various pictures published by his modelling agency, Sharky is seen posing for photographs in smart casual clothing. Propaganda prop: Abdullah Elmir, 17, from western Sydney, featured in a high-definition Islamic State broadcast earlier this year . Elmir, pictured, has not been heard from in IS propaganda since the video's syndication . Islamic State has been heavily recruiting young Australians to come to the Middle East via online videos . In a series of professional photographs, he is seen showing off high-topped leather boots, cargo pants and a colourful scarf on a picturesque Australian beach. In other pictures, he gazes down the barrel of the camera, a patterned fedora tipped forward on his head as he saunters down a laneway wearing a short-sleeve dress shirt and pants. Sharky's marketing card describes his chest, waist and collar measurements as well as his height (5'11""), suit size (38R) and shoe size (10.5). It is not known what role the young Australian played in Fallujah - the first major city to fall to the Islamic State in 2014, but there is no doubt it was very different to his Australian occupation. The Federal Government believes more than 70 Australians have fled to join the fighting in Iraq and Syria and the passports of more than 100 others have been cancelled. Other young Australians who have fled to Syria include Sydney teenager Abdullah Elmir who recently appeared in an Islamic State recruitment video.","Melbourne model Sharky Jama has reportedly been shot dead in Syria .

1,"A New York teen who lost everything in Hurricane Sandy has been accepted to seven Ivy League schools. Daria Rose, 18, immersed herself in her studies after she and her family lost everything -- including their home -- when the superstorm hit in October 2012. And after a difficult high school experience, the 18-year-old has a bright future ahead of her. The Hempstead teen has been accepted into all seven of the Ivy League schools she applied to, ABC news reports. Scroll down for video . Acceptance: New York teen Daria Rose (photographed) lost everything in Hurricane Sandy and was recently accepted to seven Ivy League schools . Dreams: The frequent moves Rose and her family underwent after the superstorm made finishing school work difficult for Rose, but she never gave up on her dream of attending an Ivy League school . 'I was like, oh my God, I just got into Harvard,' Rose told ABC 7. 'Then I checked Princeton, and I was like, oh my God I, just got into Princeton. And I checked Brown, I got in. It just kept going and going.' Rose did not apply to Columbia, according to ABC. Rose and her family lived in several hotels as well as her grandmother's house after being forced to evacuate their home in Baldwin, which was destroyed, ABC News reports. After more than a year, the family moved into a new home in Baldwin. Although the frequent moves made finishing school work difficult, Rose said, she never gave up on her dream of attending an Ivy League school. 'I was living in these small spaces but in my head I was able to escape,' Rose said 'find myself in a literary world.' Rose wrote about her Hurricane Sandy experience in a college application essay in which she talked about the storm and how reading helped her cope. Secure: A college essay about her experience helped Rose to secure a spot in Yale, Harvard, Princeton, Dartmouth, University of Pennsylvania, Cornell, and Brown . Blessing: Rose's mother, Katrina Brooks (left), said that the family's experience turned out to be a blessing because the teen had something substantial to write to the schools' admissions offices . The essay helped the Sacred Heart Academy student secure a spot in Yale, Harvard, Princeton, Dartmouth, University of Pennsylvania, Cornell, and Brown. 'After moving so much and meeting so many different people, I learned I can adapt and adjust to all these different situations and people,' Rose told ABC 7. Rose's mother, Katrina Brooks, said that the family's experience turned out to be a blessing because it provided the teen with something substantial to write to the schools' admissions offices. 'It's easy to say 'I'm just going to lay here in a ball and cry and wallow in my own self pity,'' Brooks said. 'I'd make sure she'd get up and put one foot in front of the other.'

New Home: After more than a year, the family moved into a new home in Baldwin (photographed is wreckage of Rose's home following the storm) While Rose said she had always leaned toward Yale, in her junior year of high school, she began looking at other options and decided to apply to the seven schools. Rose applied to seven of the eight Ivy League schools and, on March 31, the schools posted their decisions online, according to ABC. 'They're all such great schools,' Rose said. '[I'll] try to see where I'll fit in the best.' Rose said she plans to study political science and Russian literature. She has until May 1 to decided where she will attend.","New York teen Daria Rose lost everything in Hurricane Sandy and was recently accepted to seven Ivy League schools .

3,"A New York man was indicted Wednesday on multiple charges after allegedly strangling a relative's dog and bragging about it afterward. Police say Edward Nudel, 41, of Staten Island broke into his relative's home on March 11 and strangled a 2-year-old Pomeranian named Lola 'in an especially depraved and sadistic manner,' SILive reports.

5,"Julie McKenzie thought scoliosis was the cause of her bad back . Julie McKenzie was assured by her GP that her nagging back pain was down to a mild curvature of the spine. She'd gone to see him three months after suddenly developing back problems and had been referred for X-rays. These revealed that her spine was slightly curved, a condition known as scoliosis. 'My GP said that as far as he was concerned, my pain was the result of the scoliosis and that I should try Pilates to build up my muscle strength'. But Julie, 53, felt there was more to it - she'd always been strong and active until the pain began in the spring of 2013. As she explains: 'I'd been doing a lot of gardening, and noticed my lower back ached afterwards,' she says. 'At first a hot bath would sort it out, but as the months passed I found the aching was bad after strenuous activity, such as DIY, and didn't go away after a bath any more.' Painkillers were of little help. 'If I made a sudden movement, I'd experience a sharp, pinching pain in my lower spine that would take my breath away and force me to stop whatever I was doing.' A month after seeing her GP, and feeling increasingly desperate, Julie, an administrator, who is divorced with two grown-up children, and lives in Bushey, Herts, used her private medical cover to see a spinal surgeon, Robert Lee. The consultant ordered an MRI scan, which showed that she did have some scoliosis and her discs had signs of wear and tear, suggesting arthritis. But crucially the radiographer spotted that Julie's coccyx - the bone at the tail of the spine - was slightly enlarged. It contained a tumour. Cases like Julie's are why some experts feel that too often back pain is written off as something that is to be endured, rather than investigated. 'Eighty per cent of people will experience an episode of severe back pain in their lifetime - but only 8 per cent of these go on to suffer chronic pain,' says Peter Hamlyn, a neurosurgeon at University College Hospital London and the Spine Surgery London. 'Many of these chronic sufferers are simply dismissed as having 'non-specific low back pain'. 'That term needs to be abandoned and early referral for investigation and diagnosis-based treatment should instead become the norm.' Back pain is 'very often under-investigated', adds surgeon Robert Lee, of the Spire Hospital in Bushey. 'This means that treatable conditions such as disc prolapses, osteoporotic fractures, deformity, infection and tumours can be missed.' She sought a second opinion from a private surgeon, who sent her for an MRI scan . He adds: 'Most back pain is the result of muscular strains, and is short-lived.'As long as there are no 'red flag' symptoms - such as numbness around the groin and difficulties passing urine or with your bowels - then painkillers and physiotherapy are good approaches. 'However, an MRI should be offered when back pain goes on for eight weeks or more so that you know what you are dealing with and can treat this accordingly.' For instance, arthritis may be relieved with a simple painkilling spinal injection. If the pain is being caused by a nerve being compressed, treatment may involve surgery. Around 1,000 people a year are diagnosed with tumours - benign or malignant - that start in the spine. In many cases, a growth on the spine will be a benign notochordal tumour. These are made of tissue left over from embyronic cells which help form a baby's spinal cord. By the time a baby is born, these cells should have disappeared - if they remain, and nobody knows why this happens, they can develop into tumours. It's estimated that 14 per cent of people have this kind of benign tumour on their spine and, in most, these are harmless. Much more rarely, spinal tumours are malignant. Sometimes these are secondary to cancer elsewhere in the body, particularly breast, brain or pancreatic cancer. Cancer cells often go to the bones with the greatest blood supply, which includes the spine. These, too, can cause back pain. Less commonly, the problem is a malignant tumour called a chordoma that originates in the spine. Typically, they occur in adults between ages 40 and 70, and often they are detected late - patients live on average just six years after diagnosis. A very observant radiologist spotted a tumour, which was removed . Chordomas can occur anywhere along the spine, and the later symptoms such as back pain, numbness, aching and tingling can be mistaken for more minor strains or disc problems. As they get bigger, they may also cause changes in bowel and bladder function, and weakness of the arms and legs. In up to 40 per cent of patients they spread to the lungs, liver, bones, and skin. Although it was apparent from her MRI that Julie had a tumour, it was impossible to tell if it was cancerous or benign. The only options were to remove the entire coccyx, or leave the tumour and scan every few months to see if it grew. Mr Lee recommended removing it. 'The coccyx isn't a necessary part of our anatomy. In fact, it's simply the remains of a tail from an earlier stage in our evolution,' he says. Julie had her operation in October 2013. Her coccyx was removed, complete with the 2cm tumour inside it. The tumour was sent for testing and was found to be malignant. However, it was surrounded by healthy tissue within the bone, which meant it had not spread. 'I asked Mr Lee to tell me the results over the phone,' Julie recalls. 'I didn't know what to feel as I was in the very strange position of not actually knowing I had cancer until I was cured.' Following the surgery, sitting hurt so much that Julie was off work for six weeks. She now has a three-inch scar, and will need scans every year for five years - 'But after that we would consider her cured,' says Mr Lee. 'If the tumour was found later, the outcome could have been much bleaker.' Ironically, after the operation, Julie still has back pain as a result of her arthritis. But she feels that dealing with the pain is nothing compared with what might have been. 'I'm so pleased I made a fuss instead of leaving things,' she says. brainandspine.org.uk .","Julie McKenzie, 53, from Bushy, Herts, had a nagging back pain .

6,"(CNN)The racist and offensive emails that resulted in three Ferguson, Missouri, city employees either resigning or being fired have been released. The exchanges between the city's top court clerk and two police officers were discovered during a U.S. Justice Department investigation of racial prejudice in the city's police and judicial system. The emails -- which make offensive references to President Barack Obama, first lady Michelle Obama as well as Muslims and minorities --  were obtained by the Washington Post on Thursday after a public records request. CNN reviewed them Friday. Police Capt. Rick Henke and Sgt. William Mudd resigned early last month after the emails were discovered as part of the evidence in the Justice Department's scathing Ferguson report. The city's top court clerk, Mary Ann Twitty, was fired in connection with the emails, officials said. One email showed Ronald Reagan, an actor before becoming President, feeding a chimp in the 1951 comedy ""Bedtime for Bonzo,"" with the caption: ""Rare photo of Ronald Reagan babysitting Barack Obama in 1962."" Another showed a photo of bare-chested dancing women, apparently in Africa, with the caption ""Michelle Obama's High School Reunion!"" A June 2011 email described a man trying to put his dogs on welfare because the canines were ""mixed in color, unemployed, lazy, can't speak English and have no ... clue who their Daddies are."" Some critics have called for the department to be disbanded. Last month, embattled Police Chief Thomas Jackson resigned one week after the scathing Justice Department report slammed his department. Jackson will receive a severance payment and health insurance for one year, city officials said. Opinion: Change is coming to Ferguson . U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder ordered the Ferguson police investigation after a white police officer, Darren Wilson, shot and killed black teenager Michael Brown last summer, setting off months of sometimes violent street protests in the town outside St. Louis. The DOJ declined to bring charges against Wilson, who has since left the force. No state charges were filed. In a separate report, the Justice Department described what it said was a ""pattern and practice"" of discrimination against African-Americans by the Ferguson police and municipal courts. That discrimination included racist emails. Ferguson is a town of 21,000 that is 67% African-American. Among the findings in the report: . From 2012 to 2014, 85% of people subject to vehicle stops by Ferguson police were African-American, 90% of those who received citations were blac and 93% of people arrested were black. In 88% of the cases in which Ferguson police officers reported using force, it was against African-Americans. From 2012-2014 black drivers were twice as likely as white drivers to be searched during traffic stops, but 26% less likely to be found in possession of contraband.

7,"US President Barack Obama said on Saturday that diplomacy was the best option to deal with Iran's contested nuclear program, two days after the conclusion of a framework agreement with Tehran. Iran and six world powers determined the outlines of a landmark agreement which would curb Iran's nuclear program and potentially lift economic sanctions. As Obama gears up to sell US skeptics on the deal, he said he is convinced talks are the best way forward. Scroll down for video . US President Barack Obama says diplomacy is the best way to deal with Iran . U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and staff watch a tablet in Lausanne as U.S. President Barack Obama makes a state address on the status of the Iran nuclear program . 'As President and Commander in Chief, I firmly believe that the diplomatic option - a comprehensive, long-term deal like this - is by far the best option,' Obama said in his weekly address. Explaining that he expects a 'robust debate' on the deal in the United States, Obama said he will keep Congress apprised of the ""substance of the deal."" Many of Obama's Republican opponents in Congress have been skeptical of a deal with Iran and suggested the US may be giving too much away in its negotiations. Echoing comments he made hours after the announcement of the agreement, Obama highlighted the rigorous inspections to which Tehran will be subject. 'If Iran cheats, the world will know it. If we see something suspicious, we will inspect it,' he said. 'So this deal is not based on trust, it’s based on unprecedented verification.' According to outline text agreed to between Tehran and the P5+1 group -- the United States, Britain, China, France and Russia plus Germany -- Iran must significantly reduce its number of centrifuges in exchange for a suspension of sanctions. The outline was a major breakthrough in a 12-year international crisis over Iran's nuclear program, but the final deal has yet to be reached. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said yesterday this new agreement would 'threaten the very survival of the state of Israel' Iran's arch-foe Israel, widely assumed to have nuclear weapons of its own, reacted strongly against the deal, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying if the text becomes finalized it would threaten the survival of the state of Israel. ‘This deal would legitimize Iran’s nuclear program, bolster Iran’s economy and increase Iran’s aggression and terror throughout the Middle East and beyond,’ the prime minister said. ‘It would increase the risks of nuclear proliferation in the region and the risks of a horrific war.’ Other critics including Saudi Arabia and Republicans in the US say the deal leaves scope for Iran to cheat. Barack Obama, however, has hailed the agreement struck after tortuous negotiations in Lausanne, Switzerland, as a ‘historic understanding’. There are still many details to be thrashed out before the deal is due to be signed on June 30, including the pace at which sanctions will be lifted and what happens if Iran is found to have breached the terms.","US President Barack Obama said on Saturday that diplomacy was the best option to deal with Iran's contested nuclear program .

Despite this, critics like Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and some US Republicans argue the deal threatens Israel's security and allows Iran to potentially cheat. Saudi Arabia also shares concerns about the agreement's implications.  Finalizing the deal by June 30 requires further negotiations on sanction lifting procedures and breach consequences.

8,"A Tory councillor with a history of odd behaviour was told to put down his knife and fork after being caught tucking into a roast duck dinner during a council meeting. Jonny Bucknell, 58, was enjoying his meal in the council chamber when a Labour rival, Theo Blackwell, spotted him and alerted other councillors. He was forced to put down his cutlery when the mayor, Lazzaro Pietragnoli, interrupted the proceedings to tell him off. Taking a stand: Jonny Bucknell is no stranger to odd behaviour. In 2013 he slept in his car at the Tory party conference. He now says he wants a rule change so he can eat a roast dinner at council meetings . The mayor, who was chairing the meeting of Camden Council in north London, reminded the hungry councillor that eating was banned in the chamber. But the angry diner claims he was unaware eating there was forbidden and said he now aims to campaign for a rule change. The rumpus comes a month after Liberal Democrat councillor Martin Elengorn was caught playing Scrabble during a Richmond Council budget meeting in south-west London. Telling off: Mayor of Camden Council, Lazzaro Pietragnoli, had to tell Mr Bucknell to stop eating . When he first noticed him eating, Mr Blackwell told his fellow councillors: 'It appears that one of our Tory colleagues is consuming a full Sunday roast dinner in the council chamber. 'Could I ask the borough solicitor to give us advice on eating a full roast dinner in the council chamber? It's a little bit more than a cheeky Snickers.' The diner was forced to curtail his meal. Mr Bucknell, who has been a councillor for more than ten years and represents Belsize, Hampstead, told the Evening Standard: 'I never knew there was a ban on eating in the chamber. 'They should definitely repeal it. There is nothing wrong with nibbling from a lunch box if you are being discreet. 'It is not as if a cold meal is going to waft around like a McDonald's. 'I will be campaigning for the repealing of the law that says you can't nibble from a lunch box in the council chamber.' The Conservative councillor said the meal, in a plastic box, had travelled home with him after a French snowboarding holiday. 'The chalet always brought out too much food and I can't stand wasting food,' he said. He previously found fame when he slept in his Volvo car to save on hotel bills during the Conservative party conference in September 2013. Mr Bucknell said at the time it was to make a stand against what he called 'ridiculous prices'. He said the economy would improve if more people were thrifty like him. After the council meeting mayor Lazzaro Pietragnoli said: 'I understand councillors do a difficult job and sometimes don't get time to eat dinner. 'I also tend to be quite flexible, but having a big meal in front of him - that was a bit too much.' A Camden Council spokesman said: 'It is as the mayor said, standing orders say that members should not eat in the chamber.'

11,"Jeremy Clarkson has finally spoken out about his high-profile sacking from Top Gear, admitting he will 'miss' fronting the BBC2 show. Clarkson, 54, who was fired in March after attacking a producer during filming, has not publicly addressed his dismissal, apart from to say that 'everyone's upset'. But the presenter today gave his 'heartfelt thanks' to those who sent their support in the aftermath of his sacking, saying he would 'miss being there'. It came as Ms Rippon, 70, who first presented the show 38 years ago, said she would be keen to return to the motoring show if she were invited back. Scroll down for video . Jeremy Clarkson (left) today revealed he would 'miss' fronting Top Gear, as it emerged that former presenter Angela Rippon (right) would be keen to return to the motoring show . Ms Rippon, 70, who first presented the show 38 years ago, said it would be 'great' if she were invited back to front Top Gear . Writing in The Sun, Clarkson said: 'Heartfelt thanks to all those who have written to say how much they will miss me on Top Gear. It's not as much, however, as I'll miss being there.' Clarkson was dropped by the BBC after an internal investigation found he had launched an 'unprovoked' 30-second physical attack on producer Oisin Tymon because he was offered a plate of cold cuts instead of steak and chips. The presenter was found to have split the producer's lip and verbally abused him. Following weeks of speculation over the star's future, Lord Hall, the director-general of the corporation, publicly announced  that the BBC would not be renewing Clarkson's contract. He said Clarkson had 'crossed the line' and that 'there cannot be one rule for one and one rule for another'. Now, with the future of the show still up in the air, former newsreader Ms Rippon said it would be 'great' if she was invited back. Clarkson, who was dropped by the BBC after launching an 'unprovoked' 30-second physical attack on producer Oisin Tymon. today gave his 'heartfelt thanks' to those who have supported him . She told The Daily Mirror: 'It would be great if they said ""let's get the old girl back to do the odd film for us"". What I did all those years ago is totally different to what they do now. 'If a programme is going to have longevity, which Top Gear has, it has to keep evolving.' She added that there should be a woman included in the team - because half the drivers on the road are female. Jodie Kidd, the former model, has already been linked to the show. It also emerged last month that DIY SOS star Nick Knowles could become the new Top Gear presenter because the BBC believe he is a 'safe pair of hands'. Meanwhile, BBC bosses are said to be desperately trying to hold onto James May (left) and Richard Hammond (right) - Clarkson's co-presenters - for the BBC2 show . Mr May has previously said that the trio 'came as a package', while Hammond - not ruling out a return - said the sacking marked 'the end of an era' But BBC bosses are reportedly still trying to persuade Richard Hammond and James May to continue with the show, in a bid to cling onto long-term fans. Although May, 52, and Hammond, 45, have both hinted separately that they do not see a future with Top Gear, both have remained silent on the issue for the past few weeks. A source told the Daily Mirror: 'Richard is a TV presenter and this could be his chance to become top dog - he's been on the show a bit longer than James. That is a big opportunity to pass over.' They added: 'It would be a great shame to lose all the talent in one go - re-booting it from scratch would be a far harder task than replacing one.' Mr May has previously said that the trio 'came as a package', while Hammond - not ruling out a return - said the sacking marked 'the end of an era'. But little has been said since the initial reaction to the sacking. Some believe the presenters are remaining silent while waiting for bids from rival channels, which may want to sign up the group as a trio. All three were on the cusp of signing new three-year deals when the Clarkson fracas unfolded. Some believe the pair are remaining silent while waiting for bids from rival channels, which may want to snap up the former Top Gear group as a trio . The day after Clarkson's sacking, May gave a big hint that he has no plans to return to Top Gear, suggesting he is to ‘go back to normal life.’ The presenter admitted he was already considering what to do next with his life - and suggested he might even ditch cars to become a teacher. He said: 'I might want to do something completely different with my life, I'm quite old now. (I might do) something outside of cars, I always wanted to be a teacher.' He also seemed to confirm speculation that he would leave the top-rating programme, saying: 'We always knew it wasn't going to last forever'. Clarkson, 54, was sacked after attacking Oisin Tymon in an episode which Lord Hall said had 'crossed the line' But the BBC's creative director Alan Yentob previously made it clear he wanted May and Hammond to continue presenting the show without Clarkson, despite acknowledging it would be 'perfectly natural' for them to have reservations about continuing. He said: 'It's perfectly natural for them. They are a team they have worked together for a very long time, they are all very attached. 'If Jeremy is not in it and Richard and James are, that needs to be a conversation with them as well. They need to be happy about what's going on and where they think the programme needs to be.' May fronts several other TV programmes, including the popular James May's Toy Stories, James May's Man Lab and Oz and James' Big Wine Adventure with wine expert Oz Clarke. Hammond has a successful career as a children’s television host, fronting the second series of National Geographic's Science of Stupid. He also hosted BBC1’s physical game show Total Wipeout and the CBBC series Blast Lab before they were axed. Clarkson, May and Hammond are scheduled to take part in the live Top Gear shows next month. But the shows have been renamed, without BBC branding. Earlier this month North Yorkshire Police said that following an investigation Clarkson would face no further police action over his attack on the producer at a hotel. Clarkson pulled out of his planned appearance hosting BBC satirical show Have I Got News For You, which was due to be filmed next week, and aired a day later. It would have marked his first BBC appearance since the fracas which led to his departure.","Clarkson has not spoken publicly about sacking since news broke in March .

Ashy Bines, who is the face of the popular fitness program Ashy Bines Bikini Body Challenge, is being chased by the tax office over debts due almost 12 months ago, the Gold Coast Bulletin reports. The debts, which were due last May, include income and tax, a fine and $295,955 worth of interest. Scroll down for video . Ashy Bines, who is the face of the popular fitness program Ashy Bines Bikini Body Challenge, is being chased by the tax office over debts due almost 12 months ago . Court documents show the tax office launched action in November and has since lodged an application to liquidate ABBBC Pty Ltd - the company behind Ms Bines' bikini body challenge program. The case will be heard in a Brisbane court next Friday with Pilot Partners already consenting to be liquidators if the tax office wins. Ms Bines and her husband Steven Evans have reportedly sold their shares in ABBBC to Platinum Investment Group - a second company they are members and shareholders of. The fitness queen gave up her title as director of ABBBC just six months after they first started in April 2012. Her husband remained as the sole director of the company. But Mr Evans handed directorship of ABBBC to business associate Levi Walz in January. Mr Evans is currently locked in a court battle with rival fitness guru Emily Anderson. The Gold Coast model and body builder is suing Mr Evans for $500,000 for allegedly using her money for his other businesses and failing to promote hers effectively.

The former Another Level star, 35, is accused of hitting 31-year-old glamour model Ms Cahill in front of her young son, causing a bloody nose. Bowers, of no fixed address, was charged with common assault in connection with an incident which took place in February. Former Another Level star Dane Bowers, 35, (pictured left) is accused of hitting his ex-fiancee, 31-year-old glamour model Sophie Cahill (right) in front of her young son in February, causing a bloody nose . He answered his police bail last Thursday and today Scotland Yard confirmed he is due to appear before magistrates in south London next month. The singer and the former Miss Wales got engaged in December 2013 when he popped the question during a sunshine winter break in Tenerife. 'I am the happiest man alive. Ecstatic to say the beautiful Sophie Cahill made me the happiest man alive by saying yes..when I said the amazing words...Will you Marry me!!' he tweeted at the time, shortly after presenting her with a diamond ring. Ms Cahill, who is from Cwmbran in Gwent, also shared her delight at the time on the social networking site, posting: 'So it turns out that a Dane Bowers actually flew out to my childhood memory island to propose. I said yes!' Bowers (pictured far left) with his boyband Another Level in 1999 at the Capital FM Awards . But Ms Cahill called off their engagement last December. She was said to have dumped the singer and moved in with his mother after discovering that he had been storing pictures of other glamour models' on his mobile phone. Bowers, who previously dated glamour model Katie Price when he was in boyband Another Level, toured last November with the Big Reunion Boyband as one fifth of Fifth Story, alongside Adam Rickitt and Kavanagh, before appearing in a pantomime as Prince Charming. Mother-of-two Ms Cahill, who won Miss Wales back in 2000, has had a successful modelling career including roles in N-Dubz music videos, appearances on Channel 4's Big Breakfast and in the UK and US versions of Playboy.

16,"Until now, it has been a hidden world, protected by hundreds of feet of freezing water and 20 metres of ice. Now, researchers have created a special robo-explorer to borrow into the ice and record the first footage of what lies on the seabed below the Ross Ice Shelf. The icefin was deployed (and retrieved) the vehicle through a 12-inch diameter hole through 20 meters of ice and another 500 meters of water to the sea floor. Scroll down for video . One of the unique creatures spotted on the seabed.The icefin was deployed (and retrieved) the vehicle through a 12-inch diameter hole through 20 meters of ice and another 500 meters of water to the sea floor. A first-of-its-kind robotic vehicle recently dove to depths never before visited under Antarctica's Ross Ice Shelf and brought back video of life on the seafloor. 'We built a vehicle that's a hybrid between the really small probes and the ocean-going vessels, and we can deploy it through bore holes on Antarctica,' said Britney Schmidt, an assistant professor in the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Tech, and the principle investigator for the Icefin project. The technologies developed for Icefin will also help in the search for life on other planets, namely Europa, a moon of Jupiter. Antarctica's icy oceans are remarkably similar to Europa'sice-capped oceans. 'At the same time, we're advancing hypotheses that we need for Europa and understanding ocean systems here better. 'We're also developing and getting comfortable with technologies that make polar science -- and eventually Europa science - more realistic.' The robotic vehicle carried a scientific payload capable of measuring ocean conditions under the ice. Icefin's readings of the environment under Antarctica's ice shelves, and video of the life that thrives in these harsh conditions, will help understand how Antarctica's ice shelves are changing under warming conditions, and to understand how organisms thrive in cold and light-free environments. The icefin was deployed (and retrieved) the vehicle through a 12-inch diameter hole through 20 meters of ice and another 500 meters of water to the sea floor. A team of scientists and engineers from the Georgia Institute of Technology assembled the unmanned, underwater vehicle on Antarctica. Icefin was deployed as a part of the Sub Ice Marine and Planetary–analog Ecosystem (SIMPLE) program, funded by NASA and supported by NSF, with Schmidt as the principle investigator. The research team returned from Antarctica in December 2014. Icefin is planned to make its Arctic debut in summer 2016, with a return to Antarctica that fall, the team hopes . At McMurdo Station, Schmidt and a team including Georgia Tech scientists and engineers from the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI), led by principal research engineer Mick West, deployed Icefin to explore the underside of the ice shelves flowing off the continent. 'What truly separates Icefin from some of the other vehicles is that it's fairly slender, yet still has all of the sensors that the scientists like Britney need,' West said. The icefin was deployed (and retrieved) the vehicle through a 12-inch diameter hole through 20 meters of ice (pictured) and another 500 meters of water to the sea floor. 'Our vehicle has instrumentation aboard both for navigation and ocean science that other vehicles do not.' The Southern Ocean can be as deep as 5,000 meters. Icefin is capable of diving 1,500 meters and can perform three-kilometer-long surveys. Previous vehicles in Icefin's class were rated to a few hundred meters. 'We saw evidence of a complex community on the sea floor that has never been observed before, and unprecedented detail on the ice-ocean interface that hasn't been achieved before,' Schmidt said. Video captured by Icefin shows eerie footage of an active seafloor 500 meters under the Ross Ice Shelf. 'Biologists at McMurdo were just amazed at the amount of biology at that location which included sea stars, sponges and anemones that were at the ocean bottom,' West said. 'To have our very first deep-ocean dive happen through a small hole in the ice and go all the way to the ocean bottom and get the video we did was pretty amazing.' A partnership between research-focused GTRI and academic-focused School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences (EAS) enabled the team to design, build and deploy Icefin under the ice in less than a year.Traditional design cycles for these types of vehicles typically are two to three years. The team had to design for a number of challenges associated with deploying Icefin in such an extreme environment. For example, standard electronics systems are not typically rated to the extreme temperatures found under the Ross Ice Shelf. Icefin carries forward and up/down imaging and sonars and several different sensors. Icefin is also modular, similar to vehicles used on space missions. Scientists can swap sensors or point them in different directions as needed. Mick West poses with Icefin, the robotic underwater vehicle built by GTRI and Georgia Tech. Traditional GPS does not work under the ice, so Icefin uses a navigation system called SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) to triangulate its position based on measuring the range and bearing of features on the seafloor or under the ice. Traditional underwater vehicles deployed on Antarctica are either 'roving eyes' because they carry only a camera, or much larger vehicles that are deployed in the water on the edge of the ice shelf. Icefin fills the gap between these two kinds of vehicles: able to be deployed easily by small teams in any environment, yet still able to record oceanographic information traditionally done by much larger vehicles. 'We had probably 100 contingencies for if something went wrong,' West said. 'Through lots of analysis and robust design, we were fortunate not to have to initiate any of them.' Once Icefin was assembled, the vehicle was deployed through a bore hole in the ice that was 12 inches in diameter and 20 meters deep. Bore holes are often drilled on Antarctica for ocean moorings and sediment sampling. Traditional GPS does not work under the ice, so Icefin uses a navigation system called SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) to triangulate its position based on measuring the range and bearing of features on the seafloor or under the ice. 'Using algorithms such as SLAM allows us to construct a map of the unknown under-ice environment. 'When you can do that, you can begin to get a 3D picture of what's going on under the water,' West said. Massive icebergs clog McMurdo Sound after breaking off from the Ross Ice Shelf in Antartica, October 2003. The sensors on Icefin are helping scientists understand how the ocean affects properties of the ice, and how the ice affects properties of the ocean. The exchange between ocean and ice is a process that mediates biology, affects the climate system and controls the stability of glaciers. 'Those are important processes that we can work out here in our backyard at the same time as we're answering how an ice shell would reflect the ocean chemistry on Europa,' Schmidt said. 'The ice shell is built out of the ocean, but how that process works is not well understood.'","Footage reveals huge variety of life on the seabed .

19,"A Georgia woman is speaking out about her refusal to follow doctors' advice and pull the plug on her husband of just seven months following a devastating motorcycle crash.

Tragic: Danielle Davis says she looked to her faith when she was faced with the prospect of losing her husband Brian in 2011, just seven months after they were married when he was involved in a near fatal motorcycle crash . Davis tells WTOC that doctors told her they would have chosen to pull the plug had they been in her position. 'That's what they'd want their family to do,' she recalls hearing them say. But she refused to give up and Brian was eventually released into her care. Weeks went by and one day, miraculously, Brian spoke. 'I'm trying,' he told her. Danielle would soon come to the painful conclusion that Brian had no idea she was his wife. Brian tells WTOC that he also had no clue his father was dead or that he'd been married to begin with. Three years had been wiped from his memory for good. Though, finding out Danielle was his wife was a happy moment among many struggles. 'I saw her, and I was like, 'yeah,'' he recalls. Hopeless: Brian's motorcycle was split in two and doctors initially urged his wife to take him off life support . Danielle refused to give up on Brian and took him into her full time care as he was still bedridden and hooked to a feeding tube . Miracle: Eventually, Brian started to improve and miraculously spoke the words 'I'm trying' one day weeks after Danielle took him home with dismal prospects . Now, he and Danielle work on his rehabilitation daily and use yoga to help him sharpen his mind and regain control of his body. While Danielle is thrilled that Brian has improved to the point he no longer requires medications, she says on a GoFundMe page started for the cause that the couple is too strapped to pay for all the rehabilitative care Brian still requires. And insurance will no longer cover it. 'People with Traumatic Brain Injury need a lot of rehab, people continue to make improvements even 10 years after their injury,' she writes. 'Insurance doesn't pay for the amount of therapy they need so often times that person doesn't reach their full potential.' Thankfully, after just one month, the fundraiser has received some $11,000 in donations. As Brian continues to make great strides, most recently with his commitment to learning to walk the way he once did, he wants others to know how good they've got it. 'People don't realize how much they can actually do with their bodies,' he said. 'They take it for granted.'

The carcasses of more than 50 greyhounds were found at the bush site in Coonarr, near Bundaberg, on Tuesday. Scroll down for video . Police have charged a man and woman over the discovery of a mass greyhound dog grave in Bundaberg . A 71-year-old man and 64-year-old woman were both charged with unlawfully possessing a firearm after a police search found a rifle and ammunition in a home in Bundaberg, Queensland, on Thursday . A Queensland Police and RSPCA taskforce, set up after the greyhound racing industry was rocked by the live baiting scandal in February, also found ammunition shells from a .22 calibre gun. The pair, both from Bundaberg, will appear in the Bundaberg Magistrates Court on Friday. RSPCA spokesman Michael Beatty says it's understood the dogs were killed before a Four Corners special which exposed the horrors of the greyhound racing industry. 'The indications are that these may just be young dogs that didn't have the speed, basically. But that's really all we know,' Beatty told Fairfax media. The carcasses of more than 50 greyhounds were found at the bush site in Coonarr on Tuesday . At least 55 carcasses were found in the Coonarr area, near Bundaberg, on Tuesday, with the RSPCA. Early investigations suggest the dogs were young dogs that were killed as they were too slow . 'Unfortunately as I think most people would be aware, there's always been a lot of wastage in the greyhound industry.' Police said it was unclear how long the dogs' bodies had been there, but confirmed they were found in various states of decomposition. There were no greyhound training facilities or other connections to the racing industry in the area, a police spokesperson said. Queensland Police Minister Jo-Ann Miller expressed her outrage on Twitter after the discovery. 'Absolutely sickened that @QPSmedia and @RSPCAQLD have found the remains of 55 greyhounds. Animal cruelty in Qld won't be tolerated,' she wrote. 'The indications are that these may just be young dogs that didn't have the speed, basically.

It came after an ABC Four Corners expose from earlier this year sparked widespread outrage after showing racing dogs chasing and mauling live animals. So far, five people have been charged with a total of 23 offences in the state. An independent review headed up by barrister Alan MacSporran SC is also being conducted into the practice. It's expected to be completed in about three months' time. This review aims to find out how widespread the use of live baiting is in Queensland, and how it could go undetected for so long.

21,"Frank Lampard has revealed he'd 'love' to see a gay footballer come out and be fully respected by the public, saying that the game is changing and losing it's macho persona. Taking part on Channel Four's 'Alan Carr's Chatty Man' alongside Denise van Outen, Noel Fielding and Lethal Bizzle, the on-loan Manchester City star spoke of his support and feels that football in evolving for the better. When host Carr said: 'Do you think we will ever see a gay footballer? Statistically there should be loads. One in ten are gay aren't they? Fifty-thousand professional footballers, one of them must be.' Frank Lampard showed his support for gay footballers in an interview on Alan Carr's Chatty Man . LA Galaxy Robbie Rogers (left) came out as being gay and was heavily supported by the sporting world . Former West Ham United midfielder Thomas Hitzlsperger also came out as being gay not long after Rogers . Lampard responded: 'Well we have had a couple. Thomas Hitzlsperger who played in the Premier League, came out after having moved back to Germany or Italy. 'In America, Robbie Rogers played there. 'I think a lot of the problem is, as you say, it's a fact that it will be out there, as it is in all modern life at all times, but I think we are probably at fault as a sport. 'I think that it's that old syndrome where it's a mans game and you can't talk about that. I have to say the game's changing a lot. There are a lot of campaigns. I feel it in the dressing room. There's a different feel about it. 'Yeah there should be. I would love it if someone came out and everyone treated it with respect. You know that thing about 'we're macho we play football,' is very old hat.' With Lampard's career nearing the end, the New York City man is already thinking about what his next step will be - refusing to rule out the chance of becoming a manager. He said: 'I'll maybe do my coaching badges which is a bit of a process as that's two years worth of work to get that and maybe be a manager but I'm not completely sure whether to go down that route or down certain other routes- bit of TV maybe. The City midfielder was joined on the show by Noel Fielding (left, Lethal Bizzle and Denis van Outen . 'Everyone's lining up to do that at the moment you know the punditry thing is the thing to do. Everyone that retires wants to go in, and it's not an easy thing. It looks quite easy to talk about football but it's not.' Following England's disappointing 2014 World Cup in Brazil, Carr pressed Lampard on why we perform so bad - despite the quality in the country. Lampard, who made one appearance during the finals, believes that a lack of squad cohesion may have been the catalyst causing England to finish bottom of group D. 'I think we didn’t gel as much as we should have done,' he said. 'When you look at the individuals in those pictures (on screen) you know you're talking about some of the best individuals in world football at different times. We've had them and we haven't done it.' Van Outen and Noel Fielding also took part on the show where Lampard scored a penalty against Carr .

22,"Passengers of an Icelandair flight to Denver on Tuesday were left in a bit of shock after their plane was struck by lightning shortly after takeoff. Though the Boeing 757 continued its 3,700-mile journey from Reykjavik, Iceland, to Denver, it wasn't until the plane landed that passengers and crew were aware of a gaping hole in the nose of the plane. The hole was at a point in the plane where weather radars are housed, but the plane landed safely in Denver and no one was injured. It is unknown how many people were on board. A plane was struck by lightning shortly after takeoff during a flight from Reykjavik, Iceland, to Denver, Colorado on Tuesday . It wasn't until after landing that the passengers and crew found out the lightning strike caused a gaping hole at the nose of the plane . Passenger Kyle Hernandez, a member of the band The Bunny Gang, said that the lightning 'shook the plane and it was bright'. 'Everybody kind of got tense and we all jumped and looked at each other,' Hernandez told FOX31. His bandmate Nathen Maxwell told the Denver Post that it sounded like a 'bang and a pop'. 'At some point pretty soon after we left, we got hit. It wasn't at the halfway point,' Maxwell said. 'I thought we'd probably have to go for an emergency landing or turn around, detour or something.' Passenger Amanda Boldenow said everyone from the plane immediately walked to the terminal's windows when they arrived in Denver. 'We walked over and everyone is staring at this hole in the nose,' she said. 'Lighting had struck the plane. I had never been in a plane that had been struck by lightning, so I was really startled.' The journey from Reykjavik to Denver is about 3,740 miles. Passengers on the plane said the lightning struck shortly after takeoff . Pilots reported the lighting but continued on with the eight-hour flight to Denver. The plane landed safely and no one was injured . Aviation experts said that lightning strikes to commercial planes happen one to five times per year, according to 9News, and modern aircraft are equipped to handle these strikes. Metropolitan State University of Denver aviation professor Jeff Price said that lightning strikes that damage a plane, however, are rare. 'It could be one of those weird ""acts of God"" where it hit at the right point. The important thing is the plane landed safely,' Price said. A spokesman from Icelandair said that though people were concerned there was no detour, the pilots followed protocol in the situation. The spokesman said: 'During departure from Keflavik International Airport the Boeing 757 aircraft used for Icelandair flight 671 was struck by lightning. 'The aircraft handling characteristics and notification systems were unaffected and the flight continued. 'Lightning strikes are common and protocol was followed. There was no cause for further concern and the flight landed without issue. This aircraft was replaced upon landing and is being evaluated.' The plane has been removed from service and will be inspected and repaired and Iceland's FAA equivalent will be responsible of the investigation.","Flight was traveling from Reykjavik, Iceland to Denver when it was struck .

23,"Celtic have written to the Scottish Football Association in order to gain an 'understanding' of the refereeing decisions during their Scottish Cup semi-final defeat by Inverness on Sunday. The Hoops were left outraged by referee Steven McLean's failure to award a penalty or red card for a clear handball in the box by Josh Meekings to deny Leigh Griffith's goal-bound shot during the first-half. Caley Thistle went on to win the game 3-2 after extra-time and denied Rory Delia's men the chance to secure a domestic Treble this season.

Celtic's Adam Matthews (right) slides in with a strong challenge on Nick Ross in the Scottish Cup semi-final . 'Given the level of reaction from our supporters and across football, we are duty bound to seek an understanding of what actually happened,' Celtic said in a statement. They added, 'We have not been given any other specific explanation so far and this is simply to understand the circumstances of what went on and why such an obvious error was made.' However, the Parkhead outfit made a point of congratulating their opponents, who have reached the first-ever Scottish Cup final in their history, describing Caley as a 'fantastic club' and saying 'reaching the final is a great achievement.' Celtic had taken the lead in the semi-final through defender Virgil van Dijk's curling free-kick on 18 minutes, but were unable to double that lead thanks to the Meekings controversy. It allowed Inverness a route back into the game and Celtic had goalkeeper Craig Gordon sent off after the restart for scything down Marley Watkins in the area. Greg Tansey duly converted the resulting penalty. Edward Ofere then put Caley Thistle ahead, only for John Guidetti to draw level for the Bhoys.

24,"Bryony Hibbert (pictured), 25,  the girlfriend of the footballer caught having drunken sex in the dugout, has slammed those responsible for the clip . This is the first picture of the girlfriend of the semi-professional footballer caught having drunken sex with a female supporter in the dugout after his team's 4-1 defeat. Striker Jay Hart, 24, could be heard laughing on the mobile phone footage as he was caught romping with the mystery blonde in his club T-shirt with his tracksuit bottoms around his legs. He was dismissed after the sex clip of his tryst at Mossley AFC in Tameside was shared on social media and has now begged for his 25-year-old girlfriend Bryony Hibbert's forgiveness. The 73rd minute substitute for non-league Clitheroe FC, in Lancashire, today admitted he had no idea who the woman was and reached out to Wayne Rooney on Twitter for advice. Speaking for the first time since he was caught in the act, he said: 'All I want say is that I regret doing what I did. 'I was drunk, I'd had more than a few drinks, and I want to say I'm sorry to my family and everyone involved at clitheroe. 'I regret that I did it, not that I got caught. 'I've spoken and tried to sort things out with Bryony . 'Everyone in the world knows about it, I just want to get my apology out there. 'I haven't seen the girl since, I don't have a clue who she is, don't have a clue.' His team had just suffered a 4-1 defeat at Mossley's Seel Park stadium in the final game of the season which was billed as a 'ladies day' to attract more female supporters. The face of the blonde fan cannot be seen in the close-up footage. Hart was sacked by the club, which play in Evo-Stik Division 1 North, within hours of the footage being shared to fans. His girlfriend Bryony Hibbert, from Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, who has two young children, slammed those responsible for filming and sharing the clip. Writing on the Clitheroe Football Club Facebook page, she said: 'Have a bit of decency for the people it's affected. Thank God my kids are too young to read. It's disgusting. I bet their families are far from perfect.' Striker Jay Hart, 24,  could be heard laughing on the mobile phone footage as he was caught romping with the mystery blonde still in his club T-shirt with his tracksuit bottoms around his legs . One person who saw the film, which was shared on Twitter and Instagram, said Mr Hart was unaware he was being filmed at first. He said: 'The camera came round the dugout and there was a blonde female with her head down. The man couldn't see the camera because his eyes were closed. 'After a few seconds, he opened his eyes and laughed and the camera panned away again. I've been to Mossley AFC a few times and it's clearly their ground. The whole clip is only 10 to 15 seconds.' Mr Hart said he thinks of Ms Hibbert's  children as his own and hasn't seen them since the incident. His mother, Dawn Hart 46, also revealed Jay's younger sisters have been targeted by trolls, with someone sending the video to the youngest, aged nine. 'I know he's done wrong, but at the end of the day, he's my son and to see what people are saying about him, it's not nice,' she said. Mr Hart could be heard laughing on the mobile phone footage as he was caught romping with the mystery blonde . 'People have done a lot worse. Someone sent the video to my girls as well. 'They know something's gone on but they don't know what exactly, and to have to explain it to them when someone sends them something like that is horrible. 'It's had a knock on effect on his girls as well.' Clitheroe chairwoman Anne Barker said the player had 'brought the club into disrepute'. She said: 'I can't have somebody wearing the Clitheroe FC tracksuit bringing us down. 'It has brought the club into disrepute and it's not proper for him to scupper our reputation. I expect our players to act professionally. 'It was brought to my attention on Saturday night and dealt with through the management. I did offer to speak to him myself but Simon (Garner, the manager) said he would take care of it.' Mr Hart previously played for Colne FC and Padiham FC before joining Clitheroe, who currently sit 14th in the Evo-Stik League First Division North. First team manager Simon Garner, who signed Mr Hart, said: 'At the time of this unfortunate occurrence on Saturday, I wasn't there. I had already left the ground. 'I found out later on when I saw how it played out in Twitter. I'm disappointed but we can't control what the players do outside the time we are with them. 'They choose what they want to do. Unfortunately, Jason was wearing the club tracksuit and he knows he has let the club down, so the club has done what it has done. 'He's disappointed it has gone this far. It's going to have consequences for him beyond leaving this football club; with his family and possibly beyond that. 'Football is only a small part of it. If he had thought about what would have happened when he did it, he wouldn't have done it. He will pay for it. 'When I spoke to him, he sounded very apologetic about it. I'm disappointed for him. He will regret what he did and it was totally wrong.' No-one from Mossley AFC was available for comment yesterday.

25,"Prosecutors say they're dismissing almost three dozen criminal cases connected to four  Fort Lauderdale police officers who lost their jobs following an investigation into a racist video and text messages. The Broward State Attorney's Office reported on Thursday that they had already dropped 12 felony cases, 19 criminal misdemeanor cases and one juvenile case involving one or more of the officers. Nearly 20 more dismissals expected. The arresting officers in the cases, which include burglary, cocaine possession and aggravated assault with a firearm, are no longer on the police force. Scroll down for video . Criminal cases connected to four former Fort Lauderdale police officers have been dismissed after an investigation into a racist video and messages sent by the four cops. Above, Fort Lauderdale Police Chief Frank Adderley (far right) speaks about three of the officers' firings at a press conference in March . All of the four officers committed misconduct involving racist texts 'exchanged among themselves and former police officers', Chf Adderley said. Above, in this text, Christopher Sousa refers to killing n******' In another text message, Holding writes: 'Id have that noose ready' - in reference to black men. Jason Holding, James Wells and Christopher Sousa, all of Fort Lauderdale. were fired in March for 'department misconduct'. Alex Alvarez resigned in January . Officials say 22-year-old Alex Alvarez resigned, while 30-year-old James Wells, 31-year-old Jason Holding and 25-year-old Christopher Sousa were fired after a five-month investigation, according to The South Florida Sun Sentinel. The investigation began after a woman - Alvarez's former fiancee - filed a complaint in October. The series of text messages were filled with the N-word and other slurs, and the video included a doctored image of President Barack Obama wearing gold teeth, images of a Ku Klux Klan hood and a police dog attacking a black man. In their cellphone messages, the officers sent each other 'racial, sexist and ethically inappropriate' images and other content, including offensive comments against both Hispanics and homosexuals. They also 'criticized their coworkers' grammar, appearance, work ethic and referred to an entire shift as lazy (expletives)'. And they even talked about killing and injuring black people, CBS reported. In one text, Sousa reportedly wrote: 'Holdings we are coming and drinking all your beer and killing n******.' In another, Holding said: 'Id have that noose ready (sic)', according to the Sun Sentinel. Officer Alex Alvarez, 22, who apparently created the video (pictured: a still), resigned from the city's force in late January - before the investigation into he and his colleagues' exchanges was complete . The video for the fictitious 'The Hoods' film, which apparently used the N-word repeatedly, featured pictures of a wanted poster for 'an escaped slave' and black men looking down the barrel of a gun (pictured) The video also included photos of black men being bitten by a dog (pictured), a police investigation determined . The disturbing footage, which apparently used the N-word repeatedly, also featured pictures of a wanted poster for 'an escaped slave' and a caricature of President Obama with gold-capped teeth. All of the four officers involved in the case committed misconduct involving racist texts 'exchanged among themselves and former police officers', Fort Lauderdale Police Chief Frank Adderley said . Chief Adderley, who is African-American, added that the officers did not engage in criminal behavior, 'but their conduct was inexcusable and there is zero tolerance for this kind of behavior' in the force. A spokesman for the state attorney's office says all of the dropped cases involve black defendants. Sherman Bynes is one of the defendants whose criminal case has been dismissed. He was arrested by Holding in March 2014 . 'This is a serious matter. We continue to review each case in which these former policemen were the principal officers involved in the arrest,' spokesman Ron Ishoy told the Sun Sentinel. 'We are dropping charges against the defendants where it is appropriate.' One of the first felony cases dropped was Holding's arrest of Sherman Bynes, 36, in March 2014. Gordan Weekes, a chief assistant in the city's public defender's office called the arrest 'a classic case of driving while black'. Bynes was pulled over by Holding after rolling through a stop sign in a new Kia owned by the rental car company he worked for. Holding called for a police dog to search the car and Bynes's person and found a baggie of marijuana in Bynes' pocket and 14 grams of marijuana, a digital scale and several small plastic bags in a backpack in the trunk. He also said that Bynes was not wearing his seat belt. Holding arrested Bynes, who was charged with possession with intent to sell cannabis and traffic violations. Bynes said Holding was 'extremely aggressive toward him in his demeanor,' but used no racially offensive language during the stop, according to Bynes's lawyer. 'Holding's bias was insurmountable as he was clearly engaging in racially predatory policing that was consistent with his offensive text conversations,' Weekes said. Broward Public Defender Howard Finkelstein said that between January 1, 2014, and the time the officers left the force, they were involved in 56 felony arrests of black and other minority suspects. Chief Adderley (pictured) revealed the four officers had told him they had been just joking around. 'Based on the investigation, they felt, in their words, that it was a joke,' he said at a news conference in March . The three fired officers are disputing their termination from the force and are trying to get their jobs back. They have arbitration hearings on April 15. Fort Lauderdale Mayor Jack Seiler said in March that he was 'very disappointed, disgusted and shocked' by the inquiry's findings, describing the officers as 'a few bad apples' in a 'diverse' police department. He added city and department leadership had agreed that the multiple sackings were appropriate. Meanwhile, City Manager Lee Feldman said: 'It's extremely unfortunate that these acts of racism and hatred took place'. He also expressed his thanks toward Alvarez's fiancée for coming forward. The police department in south-east Florida, which has around 500 agents, has now created a human diversity class that all officers must attend on an annual basis in the wake of the incident. The Fraternal Order of Police Lodge #31 represents the officers. FOP President Jack Lokeinsky said everyone is entitled to due process, and the officers have the right to a fair review of the facts.

Alvarez resigned in January, while the other three were fired in March.  The Broward State Attorney's Office is dismissing almost 30 criminal cases connected to these officers, all involving Black defendants. The dismissals stem from concerns about bias in the arrests. One case involved Sherman Bynes, who was arrested by Holding for possession of marijuana after a traffic stop. 

Bynes’ lawyer alleges racial profiling.  The dismissed officers are contesting their terminations and seeking reinstatement. Chief Adderley stated the officers claimed their actions were a joke but acknowledged their conduct was ""inexcusable.""

27,"Sleepy shoppers in China have had a rude awakening – after being banned from napping in furniture store IKEA. The Swedish retailer has been forced to take action to stop visitors kicking off their shoes and going to sleep on their beds and sofas. The problem has got so bad that nappers had taken over more than half of beds and sofas in the Xihongmen IKEA shop in Beijing, The People’s Daily reported – with some even getting under the covers for a snooze. Scroll down for video . Managers at Swedish furniture store IKEA have now banned shoppers from sleeping in their beds and sofas . Sleepy shoppers have taken to kicking off their shoes and catching forty winks on the display furniture . The practice has become widespread in IKEA stores - with shoppers coming in especially to take a nap . One weary woman said she had come into IKEA especially to grab a quick forty winks in one of their ‘comfy’ beds. She said she didn’t think it was a big issue, saying: ‘Yes it may affect customers who were shopping in the store but it shouldn’t be too much of a problem.’ Another customer said: ‘Sleeping on the furniture will definitely affect other customers. I can understand the need to take a rest however if you are really having a sleep then that’s not very appropriate.’ One shopper said: 'Yes it may affect customers... but it shouldn't be too much of a problem'. Ikea disagree . IKEA employees said the problem is difficult to manage, because so many Chinese shoppers do it . But long-suffering staff at IKEA said the problem has become widespread across China – with management vowing to clamp down on the practice. Under the new rules customers will still be allowed to try out the sofas and beds, but the removal of shoes to sleep in the beds is banned. One anonymous IKEA assistant warned, however, it will be difficult to enforce the rules. ‘There are old people sleeping and many others are children, what can we say?’ they said. Another employee explained that they currently wake up shoppers if they have been sleeping for an extended period of time – but when they move them on, another quickly fills their place. By banning people from taking off their shoes, IKEA hope to stop Chinese shoppers falling asleep in the stores . Workers at IKEA shops regularly wake up exhausted shoppers - but another napper quickly takes their place . They added: ‘There are too many people doing this, it’s not possible to stop it.’ The MailOnline previously reported on the trend, which commentators saying their Beijing store is particularly popular for a nap because of its air-conditioning during the sweltering summers. It is not the first time IKEA has had to deal with over-familiar customers in China. One Shanghai Xuhui store was inundated with pensioners who would spend their time drinking the free coffee – and on the prowl for a new partner for their children. The practice became so popular that telling people you were going to IKEA became a euphemism in China for ‘going to a matchmaking event’. Genuine shoppers have been unable to see the furniture on sales because of the sleeping people on top of it . IKEA opened up their first shop in China in 1999 and the country is now home to three of the top five largest IKEA stores in the world, only beaten by one in Stockholm. After the first shop opened in Beijing, pictures emerged of shoppers camping out on the sofas with their families, reading newspapers and eating biscuits. The flat-pack chain was founded by 87-year-old Ingvar Kamprad in 1943 and it is now the world’s largest furniture retailer. IKEA first opened in Beijing in 1998, and shoppers were pictured camping out on their sofas with newspapers .","Exhausted shoppers regularly fall asleep in IKEA stores across China .

28,"He was the quiet Irishman with the hipster beard who plunged the Great British Bake Off into a storm of controversy over a Baked Alaska. Belfast-born Iain Watters had to leave the show after he binned his baked Alaska after the ice cream was left out of the freezer and it melted. But now he's back with his modern take on traditional fruity Easter  fare - a Simnel cake. Scroll down for video . Former Great British Bake Off contestant, Iain Watters, is back to revive Easter classic, the Simnel cake . Packed with moist fruit and marzipan, Simnel cake has been enjoyed since the Medieval times during Easter. Topped with 12 balls of marzipan to celebrate the 12 apostles, the cake already has a distinctive appearance but Iain has taken that even further by dying it green. Working alongside shopping website ao.com, Iain offers up a modern update on the fruit-based cake, with the twist of pistachios, figs and nutmeg seasoning. The Simnel cake took a backseat for years, replaced by other classics such as hot cross buns - until this Easter. Perhaps the trendy construction engineer can convince a new generation of bakers to attempt this hearty cake. The Belfast-baker puts a modern twist on the Easter favourite with pistachios, nutmeg and chopped figs . Instead of almond marzipan, Watters' modern update has pistachio marzipan, and the cake is decorated with orange zest and edible rose petals . The Irish baker opts for a pistachio-based marzipan, and flavours the sponge with orange zest, chopped figs and nutmeg. The recipe was created by Iain after it was revealed by ao.com that the Simnel cake was enjoying a resurgence this Easter. A survey by the shopping website also revealed that 58 per cent of the population would be indulging in home baking to celebrate Easter. For the cake: . For the pistachio marzipan: . Method: . 1. For marzipan, finely grind the pistachios in a food processor. Add the icing sugar and grind to a really fine mixture, then tip into a mixing bowl. Lightly whisk 1 egg white with a fork and stir in. Using your hand, knead the mixture until smooth. You may not need all the egg white take care as it can become too wet very quickly . 2. Wrap in cling film and allow to rest in the fridge while you are making the cake . 3. Heat the oven to 170°C/325°F/Gas mark 3, and grease and line a 22mm round, deep cake tin . 4. Prepare the figs by chopping then into large pea sizes and set aside . 5. Sift the self-raising flour and finely grate the nutmeg and set aside . 6. Beat the margarine and sugar until light and fluffy; you can use a wooden spoon or an electric whisk or mixer. Then add all the eggs including egg yolk, along with the sifted flour and grated nutmeg and beat until well combined . 7. Now fold in the fig until thoroughly dispersed . 8. Pour the mixture into the prepare cake tin and bake for 35-40mins. Inserted skewer in to the center of the cake if it comes out clean it’s done . 9. Leave to cool on a wire rack then remove from the tin and discard the lining paper . 10. Trim the top of the cake so you have a flat top for the marzipan to sit on . 11. Roll out two-thirds of the pistachio marzipan to a circle to fit the top of the cake. I rolled out the marzipan and used the base of the cake as a template and cut around it to form a perfectly sized disc Brush the top of the cake with a little warm apricot jam or honey and set the marzipan disc on top . 12. Shape the rest of the marzipan into 12 balls and arrange around the edge, again stick them on with a little warm apricot jam or honey . 13.

32,"Roaming. The word suggests travelling with a worry-free, devil-may-care attitude. But in the world of mobile phones, where roaming means using your device abroad, that approach is unwise. Making calls, downloading emails and browsing the internet when in another country can result in very large bills. So how can you keep roaming costs down? The best option is to be with mobile operator Three. Its customers can call and text UK numbers and use data in some countries at no extra cost to their UK price plans. Three is the only operator to offer this arrangement, which it calls Feel At Home. Three's Feel at Home covers 18 destinations in Europe, Australia, the United States, Asia and the Middle East . In September 2013, when Three introduced Feel At Home, it covered seven destinations. I said then that to be a game-changer it needed to expand the service to more countries – and it has. With Spain and New Zealand added earlier this month, it now applies in 18 countries. In Europe, the deal also covers France, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Ireland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland. Elsewhere, it covers Australia, the United States, Hong Kong, Macau, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Israel. Given that Spain, France, Italy and the US are among the most popular destinations for Britons, Three claims that about two-thirds of its customers’ overseas trips are now covered by Feel At Home. A word of warning. Three publicises Feel At Home by saying that it enables you to ‘use your phone abroad at no extra cost’. But to call or text non-UK numbers – imagine you are in Spain and you phone a restaurant in Barcelona – you will be charged extra, at roaming rates. However, these are much lower than other operators’ standard rates in some countries – for example, 15.6p per minute to call local numbers in the US, Australia and New Zealand. There are some other caveats, too – one being you can’t ‘tether’ (use your phone to connect another device to the internet). Check all details on three.co.uk/feelathome. Nonetheless, if you’re travelling to a Feel At Home country, using Three is the most preferable option. When travelling, operators’ bundles/ add-ons usually offer better value than their standard rates . Take roaming in New Zealand. On their standard rates for pay-monthly customers, rival operators charge up to £1.50 a minute for making and receiving calls, 35p to 50p for sending a text, and up to £8 per megabyte of data usage. In EU countries, roaming charges are much lower as they are capped. On operators’ standard rates, you’ll pay about 18p or 19p per minute to make a call, 5p per minute to receive a call, 5p to 6p to send a text and 20p per megabyte of data. If you’re not with Three and are heading to a Feel At Home destination, operators’ bundles/ add-ons usually offer better value than their standard rates – though it depends on your usage levels. To give one example, Vodafone lets you use your UK’s plan allowance for calls, texts and data for £3 a day in Europe, and £5 a day in some countries further afield. However, you will need to actively sign up to get this deal. If you have an unlocked handset, you might consider investing in a local, country-specific SIM card: see 0044.co.uk, uk2abroad.com or dataroam.co.uk for details. Otherwise, stick to using free wi-fi in, for example, hotels and cafes, which will also enable you to chat for free if you have a Skype or Viber account.

Pasquale Marino, pictured managing Pescara in 2013, brought Sanchez into the Udinese first team  in 2008 . The main problem he encountered, however, was that he could not keep Sanchez off the pitch. ‘Alexis could easily play three matches per day,’ Marino, now in charge of Vicenza, said. ‘As soon as the (training) match started, Alexis used to abandon the scarico and would run up to me, almost imploring: “Mister, let me play, just for a few minutes. Please, please, please. I promise I won’t get injured.” Football is an enormous pleasure for him.’ That hunger earned him two £30million moves, first to Barcelona in 2011 and then to Arsenal last summer. It is also why Sanchez, Arsenal’s stand-out player this season, found it so difficult when he was rested for two games by Arsene Wenger — against Aston Villa and Tottenham — with a sore hamstring. Sanchez spent five years with Serie A side Udinese before earning a move to Spanish giants Barcelona . Sanchez takes on  defender Miranda during Chile's friendly with Brazil at the Emirates Stadium last week . ‘Putting him on the bench is like taking a toy from a child,’ Marino warned. ‘There was just one thing that worried me when he joined Barcelona — they were full of amazing forwards and it was by no means a given that Alexis would be in the starting 11. ‘Since I know how important it is for him to play, I feared that without regular football he could become discouraged. But he proved he was good enough to become an essential part of the team and fitted into the Barca way of playing.’ Big money moves have not sapped any of Sanchez’s energy. Speak to Arsenal players and they describe the same enthusiasm in training, the same refusal to embrace rest days, the same disregard for ‘scarico.’ Sanchez found it difficult when he had to be rested for Arsenal's matches with Aston Villa and Tottenham . They warned him that when the games rained down over the winter it would soon catch up with him, but Sanchez, bar that short Wenger-enforced break, has not stopped, even if he hasn’t been as prolific as he was in the first half of the season. That is why Marino believes Sanchez, still only 26, could elevate himself alongside the planet’s greatest. ‘He’s never looked as strong as he does now,’ Marino said. ‘Personally, I think he could score more than 35 goals a season in any league he plays in. ‘If he succeeded in doing that, he would be at the same level as two monsters of the modern game: Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. Nowadays only those two, and maybe Zlatan Ibrahimovic, can claim to be better than Alexis.’ Marino believes Sanchez is looking strong and capable of scoring 35 goals  in any league he's played in .","Alexis Sanchez has starred for Barcelona and Arsenal since Udinese days .

Marino brought Sanchez into the first team at Udinese in 2008 after signing from Cobreloa two years prior. Despite competition with Antonio di Natale, Simone Pepe, and Fabio Quagliarella for starting spots, Marino believed Sanchez to be a standout talent. Alexis' recent success at Arsenal is linked to his £30m switch from Barcelona, where he impressed despite playing three matches per day in training due to his high energy levels and insatiable desire to play football.","Alexis Sánchez's relentless work ethic and desire to play earned him the admiration of former Udinese manager Pasquale Marino. Despite being rested twice this season, Sánchez maintains his high energy levels during training, much like during his time at Udinese.  Marino believes Sánchez's current form could see him achieve over 35 goals per season, placing him alongside Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo as one of the world's best.   
","Alexis Sanchez's former manager Pasquale Marino praises his work ethic. Sanchez would often ditch recovery days to play more. Marino believes Sanchez, 26, could score 35+ goals/season, elevating him alongside Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo if he maintains his strength and enthusiasm.","Pasquale Marino, Sanchez's former manager at Udinese, describes him as a tireless player who always wanted to be on the pitch. Sanchez's intense desire to play led to successful transfers to Barcelona and Arsenal. Despite initial concerns about his playing time at Barcelona, Sanchez thrived and became an integral part of the team. Now at Arsenal, he continues to display the same relentless work ethic, even after a brief enforced rest period. Marino believes Sanchez has the potential to reach the level of Messi and Ronaldo, capable of scoring over 35 goals a season.

34,"Alastair Cook still has the full support of his coach, team-mates and selectors and is unbeaten in four Tests. But his hopes of remaining England captain in the Ashes this summer hinge on what is going on back home. The opinions of ECB chairman-elect Colin Graves, new chief executive Tom Harrison and the man they eventually make director of cricket matter far more than what anyone in the Caribbean thinks. The three half-centuries Cook made in his last four Test innings of last summer count for little now as his battle to prove he remains the best man for the job nears crunch time. England captain Alastair Cook is not concerned about his failure to hit a Test hundred since May 2013 . Cook remains England's leading century maker despite his recent failure to score a Test century . Cook (right, pictured with Gary Ballance) and his team-mates are preparing for England's second Test . The second Test that starts here is not exactly make or break for Cook but he needs runs and a victory as much as at any time in a career that has seen him score more Test centuries than any other Englishman. The decision of Graves and Harrison to sack Paul Downton as managing director and announce that they are looking for a new ‘supremo’ to replace him has placed Cook and Peter Moores under more pressure than ever. By definition, the new powers at the ECB cannot have been happy about the big decisions Downton made in a traumatic 14 months and few were bigger than the move to bring back Moores as coach and the continued backing of Cook. England could not have done much more to force victory in Antigua on a pitch deader than Monty Python’s parrot but their failure to beat West Indies has made the remaining two Tests vital. Cook was both proactive and imaginative for much of that first Test but he is a captain who leads mainly by example and simply has to break a run that now sees him without a Test century for 33 innings. The statistics certainly make grim reading for Cook. In 21 of those 33 innings he has not passed 25 and his Test average of 45.65 is lower than at any time since the 2010-11 Ashes. Since the last of his 25 Test centuries, against New Zealand at Headingley in May 2013, he is averaging under 29. If England really do want a change at the top then it must come sooner rather than later, particularly if, as expected, they would bypass vice-captain Ian Bell and go straight to the man who now seems the heir apparent, Joe Root. The only way for Cook to stop the questions about his lack of a big innings is to replicate the form he has been showing in practice here with his new slightly open stance and go back to churning out the runs. ‘I have been working with Goochie on a number of things, as you always do,’ said Cook of his decision to work with Graham Gooch, his old mentor and the man he sacked as England batting coach. ‘You’re always trying to tinker with your technique and might fall into certain habits at various times in your career. Joe Root lays on the ground to check out the pitch while Cook (right) and Jos Buttler (centre) look on . Cook (left), Moeen Ali (centre) and Adil Rashid (right) go for a gentle jog at the National Cricket Ground Stadium . ‘But the most important thing is not to concentrate too much on technique when you are out in the middle. You have to concentrate on what is important — the ball coming down to you, the situation you’re in and the conditions. ‘I’m a resilient guy who tries to play each ball on its merits for as long as possible, that’s what my success has been built on, and I remain desperate to set the tone at the top of the order with some runs.’ It was hoped that the pitch at a National Stadium here that was rebuilt after the devastating hurricane of 2004 would have a bit more pace than Antigua but Cook expressed his ‘surprise’ at how wet and soft it was, at least on Sunday. That means England will consider bringing in leg-spinner Adil Rashid for Chris Jordan, while Moeen Ali looks certain to return in place of James Tredwell, who has been ‘struggling’ with a shoulder problem suffered in Antigua. The ‘big two’ of record-breaking Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad will both play despite a demanding first Test while Jonathan Trott, rightly, carries on as opener with Cook despite his two failures on his return to the side in Antigua. There is much promise in this England team, particularly in a middle order that will see one of Moeen, Jos Buttler or Ben Stokes batting as low as eight, but questions remain about the man at the top. It is up to Cook to answer them. Cook warms up during the England nets session at the National Cricket Ground Stadium in St George .

Sportsmail understands Law's representatives have fielded calls from no fewer than ten English clubs. But Brighton, Birmingham and Reading are showing the strongest interest in a player who also the target of January interest from Bolton boss Neil Lennon and Huddersfield Town. Rangers Nicky Law (right) scores one of his two goals against Raith Rovers on Sunday . Law scored twice in Sunday's 4-0 rout of Raith Rovers to take his tally for the season to 12 and has been a rejuvenated figure under interim manager Stuart McCall, his former Motherwell boss.

'I'm not really worried or thinking about it too much because a big part of it will come down to whether or not we are successful. 'After that, if we've done that, then there is probably a better chance of people getting contracts.' Rangers pair Ian Black (left) and Kris Boyd take part in a training session at Ibrox last week . Meanwhile, former Rangers starlet Lewis Macleod will almost certainly not kick a ball for Brentford this season after his £850,000 January move. The Scotland Under 21 star was expected to make a big impact as the Griffin Park side battled for a shock place in the English Premier League for the first time. Macleod suffered a hamstring injury in his final game for Rangers at Alloa's Indodrill Stadium in December. He's suffered further setbacks at the London club and has so far only managed to play 45 minutes for Brentford reserves since his move.

He explained: 'He's coming along. We have to be fair to the player. I want him to be involved. 'He's been out for three or four months and he's got to be comfortable that he can commit 100 per cent. 'The last thing you want to do is put a player on with a doubt in his mind with regards to a sprint, challenge, jump or tackle. He's very close but we have to be fair to the player.'

36,"Two GOP presidential hopefuls - Ted Cruz and Ben Carson - want the Clinton Foundation to return every dollar its received from foreign governments since it launched more than a decade ago. The bum rush on the non-profit came about after a report cast a new shadow over the charity's fundraising practices while Hillary Clinton served as the United State's chief diplomat. A Reuters investigation that revealed the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation had misreported millions of dollars in donations from foreign nations led the global charity to announce that it would refile more than five years of tax documents. Scroll down for video . A Reuters investigation that revealed the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation had misreported millions of dollars in donations from foreign nations led the global charity to announce that it would refile more than five years of tax documents - Republicans pounced . The discovery came as separate financial reviews found that previously unreported foreign businesses either donated money directly to the family foundation or paid Bill to speak while their countries were doing official business with the State Department during Hillary's tenure. In one instance,  Bill Clinton received one of his biggest paychecks in $500,000 for a June 2010 speech in Moscow funded by an investment bank with ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Clinton Foundation was barred by an agreement from accepting money from foreign governments it wasn't already in business while Mrs. Clinton was in President Barack Obama's cabinet. But that didn't stop it from doing so anyway. It fessed up in February to accepting a $500,000 donation from Algeria in 2010 without telling the State Department. And the agreement is not known to have put restraints on Mr. Clinton's ability to collect paychecks from foreign actors. Taking aim at Hillary Clinton, Cruz said in a Wednesday evening Facebook, 'Having raised tens of millions of dollars from foreign nations presents a clear conflict of interest for anyone running for President of the United States.' 'Add your name if you agree Hillary Clinton should return all money raised from foreign nations!' the Texas senator added, soliciting names for a petition urging the non-profit to give back the funds. Carson told Daily Mail Online today that he, too, believes the charity cough up the cash. 'It is my strong belief that not only should they definitely give back the money and cease accepting foreign donations, but should also make every effort to find missing documents that would shed light if in fact they are innocent,' he said.. Two GOP presidential hopefuls - Ted Cruz, left, and Ben Carson, right - want the Clinton Foundation to return every dollar its received from foreign governments since it launched more than a decade ago . 'It's the Clinton way: raking in millions from foreign governments behind closed doors while making promises about transparency that they never intended to keep,' former business executive Carly Fiorina wrote on Facebook. 'Now they're scrambling to refile their taxes and account for her decisions as Secretary of State.' After Clinton made official her candidacy for the Oval Office, the foundation said it would impose a moratorium on checks from foreign governments that it's not already partnered with - but it still plans to take money from governments it has recently done work with. Carson, who is expected to jump into the 2016 race on May 4, said in his statement that 'one of the things that has become clear' in his travels across the country 'is that the American people are sick of corruption and dishonesty within the government.' 'Doublespeak and redefining terms to fit a narrative is truly unacceptable and misleading. The Clinton Foundation and the appearance of wrongdoing reinforces these feelings,' the retired neurosurgeon and tea party icon said. 'Anyone who contemplates a leadership position in our great nation should thoroughly examine their motives to determine if they are simply interested in enriching themselves and enhancing their own power versus strengthening America and passing it on to the next generation in an improved and ethical condition,' he posited. 'Add your name if you agree Hillary Clinton should return all money raised from foreign nations!' Ted Cruz said in a Facebook post soliciting names for a petition urging the non-profit to give back the funds . Former business executive Carly Fiorina, who will reportedly announce her own candidacy the same day as Carson via social media, stopped short of demanding that the Clinton Foundation start writing checks for money it likely doesn't have in the bank if they were cashed. She did use the opportunity to levy an attack on Clinton, however, whom she's positioned herself next to in the field as an alternative to for voters looking to break the glass ceiling by electing a woman president. 'It's the Clinton way: raking in millions from foreign governments behind closed doors while making promises about transparency that they never intended to keep,' Fiorina wrote on Facebook. 'Now they're scrambling to refile their taxes and account for her decisions as Secretary of State.' 'The American people will have a choice. Are we going to demand trust and transparency from our leaders? Have we had enough of a ruling political class that doles out favors to the wealthy and well connected few?' she said, previewing her stump speech. South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, who is testing the waters for a 2016 campaign, said, 'These stories today raise some very serious questions about the donations and relationships around the Clintons and their foundation.' 'I believe Secretary Clinton owes the public some answers about any potential impropriety,' he told Daily Mail Online.

Paul told Fox News' Sean Hannity on Tuesday evening that the expose's author, Peter Schweizer, had briefed him 'and the facts are going to be alarming. They're going to be mind-boggling.' The Kentucky senator said he was bound to secrecy on the contents of the 186-page investigative book, Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich.' 'But I think people are going to be blown away by the details in this book and how they link the Clintons into this enormous exchange of money from foreign countries, from donors to companies, and then it's all swirling around,' he told Hannity. 'And I don't think it would happen if you didn't have somebody who was a secretary of state and a former president, and they seem to be capitalizing on their service in government,' he contended. Continuing, Paul implied that the Clintons were 'using the system to enrich themselves,' and said, 'I think it looks unseemly.

37,"A bizarre new dinosaur with bat-like wings has been discovered by a farmer in China and is now helping to shed new light on the evolution of flight. Palaeontologists in China say the impeccably preserved fossil belongs to a small dinosaur thought to have lived 160 million years ago. The strange-looking creature had small stiff feathers on its body and long finger-like bones extending from each wrist that were covered in a membrane like a bat’s wing. Scroll down for video . The new dinosaur, named Yi qi (shown above in the artists reconstruction), had unusual bristle-like feathers and bat-like wings that were covered in a membrane. The dinosaur may have been able to glide and even flap . Scientists believe the dinosaur, which they have named Yi qi, meaning ‘strange wing’, may have glided or even flown through the air. The discovery has provided new insight into how vertebrates first began to take to the air. A new lineage of dinosaur that grazed on plants, despite being closely related to notorious carnivore Tyrannosaurus rex, has been discovered in Chile. Palaeontologists are referring to Chilesaurus diegosuarezi as a 'platypus' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of characteristics, including its small skull and feet. These features are more like those seen on long-neck dinosaurs. The animal is proving to be an evolutionary jigsaw puzzle because it belongs to the theropod group of dinosaurs - which were predominantly carnivorous and included the famous meat eaters Velociraptor, Carnotaurus and Tyrannosaurus, from which birds today evolved - but was a vegetarian. The presence of herbivorous theropods was up until now only known in close relatives of birds, but Chilesaurus shows  a meat-free diet was acquired much earlier than first thought. The dinosaur from the Late Jurassic Period, around 145 million years ago, is named after the country where it was discovered, and Diego Suárez, who discovered the bones. Palaeontologists are referring to Chilesaurus diegosuarezi (illustrated) as a 'platypus' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of features . Researchers say the dinosaur, which would have weighted just 13 ounces (380g) and was 33cm (12 inches) long with a wings that spanned 60cm (23 inches), may have been an early evolutionary experiment with flight. Yi qi belongs the group of carnivorous dinosaurs known as the therapods - which includes Tyranosaurus rex and velociraptor. These dinosaurs are thought to have been the ancestors of modern birds. But unlike modern birds, Yi qi was found to have a strange extra  bone extending backwards from its wrist, rather like an entirely separate group of animals that learned to fly - the bats. Professor Xing Xu, one of the world’s leading prolific palaeontologists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing and who led the work, said: 'This is really something for me. It is the most unexpected discovery I ever made. 'Birds are descended from dinosaurs, but how exactly the transition occurred is not really clear. This new discovery is a new species of these bird like dinosaurs. 'This dinosaur is totally different. It has totally different wings from all other birds and their close relatives. 'Close to the origin of birds there are many lineages trying to get into the air but there was only one group that succeeded. 'I would have said this example shows how much experimentation close to this transition.' The discovery comes in the same week as researchers announced the discovery of a bizarre vegetarian relative of the T-Rex. The Yi qi fossil was discovered by a local farmer in Mutoudeng, in Qinglong County, Hebei Province in China. The fossil has preserved stiff filamentous features on the forelimb and hindlimb, along with patches of the membrane that once stretched across its wings. However, it was the strange wrists and long rod-like bones that extended from them that baffled the attention of the palaeontologists. There are three main groups of flying vertebrates - the birds, which evolved from dinosaurs, pterosaurs that were flying reptiles that existed alongside the dinosarus, and the bats, which are mammals that evolved after the extinction of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago. Most winged avian dinosaurs to be discovered so far all have wing structures that are similar to those of modern birds. However, Yi qi, which is pronounced 'ee chee', appears to be a weird hybrid between a dinosaur and a bat. This suggests that at the time several different types of winged dinosaurs evolved wings in an attempt to fly. The fossil of Yi qi (above) was so well preserved that bristle-like feathers and the remains of its membrane wings could be seen around the bones. The strange long bone extending from the wrist was highly unusual . This close up of the skull of Yi qi, which weighed just 13 ounces (380g), show oval like feathers near the head . Analysis by Professor Xu and his colleagues, which is published in the journal Nature, suggest that it is likely the dinosaur glided, perhaps like modern flying squirrels. The dinosaur lacked the strong muscle attachments to the forelimb bones and its bone structure would have interfered with the flapping and rotating movements needed during powered flight. Instead it may have launched itself from elevated perches and glided to the ground. If it did flap its wings it would probably have only been able to fly over short distances. But Professor Xu said: 'We thought giving this animal a name meaning ""strange wing"" was appropriate, because no other bird or dinosaur has a wing of the same kind . 'We don’t know if Yi qi was flapping, or gliding, or both, but it definitely evolved a wing that is unique in the context of the transition from dinosaurs to birds.' It is likely that the conclusions will be controversial with other evolutionary biologists, but it could prove hugely valuable in unravelling how birds evolved from their dinosaur ancestors. Professor Zheng Xiaoting, from Linyi University in Shandong who also took part in the study, said: 'Yi qi lived in the Jurassic, so it was a pioneer in the evolution of flight on the line to birds. 'It reminds us that the early history of flight was full of innovations, not all of which survived.' Dr Kevin Padian, a palaeontologist at the University of California Berkeley, warned that the animal may not have been able to fly at all. The fossil of Yi qi was discovered by a farmer working his fields in Mutoudeng in Qinglong County in China . The diagrams above show how  the wing of Yi qi (a) compares to other winged tetrapods (b and c) and the wing of a bat (d), the wing of a pigeon (e), the wing of a pterosaur (f) and the wing of a Japanese flying squirrel (g) He said: ‘As for gliding, if Yi qi’s styliform element helped to support a membranous aerofoil, it can be used to reconstruct the planform of the wing, as Xu and colleagues have done. ‘But in a gliding animal, the centre of lift of the aerofoil should be fairly congruent with the centre of gravity of the body — if the bulk of the animal’s weight falls too far behind the centre of lift, the back end will sag and the animal will stall. ‘That is clearly the case in the authors’ reconstruction of Yi qi, but an aerofoil that was swept back more, if anatomically possible, might have mitigated this problem. ‘Still, we are left in a quandary: an animal with a strange structure that looks as if it could have been used in flight, borne by an animal that otherwise shows no such tendencies. ‘And so far, there is no other plausible explanation for the function of this structure.’","Yi qi is thought to have lived 160 million years ago during the late Jurassic .

Another recent discovery is Chilesaurus diegosuarezi, a plant-eating theropod dinosaur from Chile.  This finding challenges the traditional view of theropods as primarily carnivorous, suggesting vegetarianism emerged earlier than previously thought. 


","* A bizarre dinosaur, Yi qi, with bat-like wings was discovered in China, dating back 160 million years.
* It had stiff feathers, long finger-like bones, and a membrane-covered wing.
* Scientists believe it may have glided or flown, shedding new light on the evolution of flight.
* The discovery reveals experimentation with flight among vertebrates before birds evolved.
* Yi qi belongs to the theropod group, which includes Tyrannosaurus rex and the ancestors of modern birds.","A newly discovered dinosaur named Yi qi, meaning ""strange wing,"" has shed light on the evolution of flight. This small dinosaur, dating back 160 million years, possessed unique bat-like wings with a membrane stretched over elongated finger bones extending from its wrists.  Yi qi's unusual wing structure suggests it may have glided rather than powered flight due to its lack of strong muscle attachments for flapping.

The discovery, alongside the recent finding of a vegetarian relative of Tyrannosaurus rex in Chile (Chilesaurus diegosuarezi), highlights the diverse evolutionary paths dinosaurs took. Yi qi's fossil, found in China, offers valuable insight into the early experimentation with flight among dinosaurs and challenges existing theories about the transition from dinosaurs to birds.  

While its exact capabilities remain debated, Yi qi's unique wing structure points to a period of innovation and exploration in the evolution of flight.

Mixing it up: Known for blending dance and rap artists in to the lineup, Macklemore performed on the 2014 bill . Gudinski believes that touring festivals will eventually be phased out altogether in Australia.

40,"Tim Sherwood returned to White Hart Lane with his Aston Villa side on Saturday and recorded a hugely important 1-0 victory against Tottenham to dramatically increase his team's chances of Premier League survival. Sherwood is renowned for his fiery displays on the touchline, so how did he fare during what is undoubtedly one of the more emotive fixtures for him? Sportsmail explains... Tim Sherwood was visibly delighted at recording a victory with Aston Villa against Tottenham . CROWD REACTION . All was going well until his exuberant celebrations at the final whistle, which prompted an angry reaction from the home fans in the West Stand but he merely shook his fist at them and disappeared down the tunnel. Got an easy ride during the game, though, as the overmatched Vlad Chiriches bore the brunt of the home crowd's frustration before he was hooked in the 78th minute. Gave the Villa fans a wave after they asked for one in the 16th minute. Tottenham defender Vlad Chiriches (left) bore the brunt of the home fans' dismay against Villa . TOUCHLINE BEHAVIOUR . The bright spring day in N17 allowed to him leave his gillet indoors so there were no flying jackets this time. He did not leave his seat until the eighth minute then remained standing for the most part. Little more than a subtle fist pump when Christian Benteke scored what proved to be the winner but his emotions poured out at the final whistle. Clearly still loves having a go at 4th official, who got an earful on occasion. Christian Benteke (centre) headed the winning goal for Villa on the 35th minute at White Hart Lane . Sherwood coud not resist a lively celebration when the final whistle confirmed the victory for Villa . Told someone on the Spurs bench to 'shut the f*** up' as tempers flared on the bench during stoppage time. INTERACTION . Very little on this front with Tony Parks, who was one of his lieutenants here at Spurs, doing most of the talking. Stayed ice cool throughout although did nearly hit the roof when Andreas Weimann shot tamely at Michel Vorm with five minutes to go. Sherwood (centre) celebrated in a subdued manner when Benteke's header found the back of the net . Sherwood (left) and assistant Tony Parks were lively throughout the game on the touchline . Did not even acknowledge Sanchez as he meandered down the following his stoppage time red card. TACTICS . Like he did here with Emmanuel Adebayor, Sherwood has shown once again that he knows how to get a striker scoring. Christian Benteke, who fronted a three-pronged attack, scored the winner before the manager set his side up perfectly to deal with the second half Spurs fight back, although it never seemed to come. Benteke points to the sky in celebration after hitting the back of the net for Villa at Tottenham . Sherwood has helped Belgium striker Benteke rediscover his scoring form since taking over . VERDICT . Low-key return for Sherwood who nailed the game plan and left with three precious points for his side. Looks a different, more relaxed man to the one who could be spotted in the home technical area here during the second half of last season. Although he showed a glimpse of the old Tim at the final whistle as his side took a step closer to Premier League safety.

41,"When Stacey Johnson was diagnosed with a brain tumour, her whole family was heartbroken. The pain of a cancer diagnosis never went away, but after eight years of battling the condition, they cared for her and began to live with the disease. But though she had experienced enough grief, Stacey Johnson was soon delivered another cruel blow - doctors discovered her younger sister Dannii also had a growth in her brain. Stacey, now 22, was diagnosed with an inoperable  tumour in 2007 and has undergone gruelling rounds of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Her sister, Dannii, now 20, helped her mother care for her throughout her teenage years, and became her full-time carer last year. Stacey Johnson (left), 22, from Much Hadham, Hertfordshire, had just been told her brain tumour had grown when she was dealt another blow - her sister Dannii, 20, also had a tumour . Stacey (left) and Dannii (right) have grown up sharing their toys and clothes, and now find themselves both battling ill . In December 2014, Stacey was told her brain tumour, called an astrocytoma, had grown. The family, who live in Much Hadham, Hertfordshire, began to process this frightening news, wondering what treatment Stacey would now have to undergo. But they then suffered another shock – as Dannii was diagnosed with a brain tumour. She had been feeling ill and had suffered headaches, so had gone to her doctor who had referred her for tests that confirmed there was a growth in her brain. She describes her surprise at being told her headaches were being caused by a brain tumour. Dannii said: 'I had never expected it to be a tumour. 'I have been with Stacey through it all and it never even occurred that me that that's what it could be. 'I was really shocked when they told me, but I just got on with it really. Dannii had been Stacey's full time carer since last year, but began to suffer headaches and feel ill. She was shocked to discover she too had a tumour, although hers is benign . Stacey has never been able to work since her diagnosis eight years ago, and has undergone gruelling chemotherapy. She is pictured here with her sister in 2012 . 'I was down for a few days after I was diagnosed, but I thought I can't do anything about it, so I just thought I had to get on with it.' Stacey, who is due start her next round of chemotherapy soon, said the news was so shocking it didn't seem real. She said: 'It sort of felt like a dream and I thought I was going to wake up from it. 'She is one of those types of people who just gets on with it. We are helping each other through it.' The sisters live with their mother, Sharon, 47, their father Brian, 48, and brother Charlie, 28. They were both born with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) - a condition that causes café au lait spots (flat brown birthmarks) on the skin, freckles in unusual places, and benign lumps and bumps. One third of people with the condition will have one or more medical complication during their lifetime, which can include either benign or cancerous brain tumours. However, it is unclear whether the NF1 is related to the sisters' growths, and they say they have been told there probably is no link. Dannii is now awaiting a scan to see if it has grown and what the best course of treatment will be. Both sisters were born with neurofibromatosis type 1 - a condition that causes benign lumps and bumps, although they do not know if it is related to their development of brain tumours . Dannii said she was shocked when she too was diagnosed. She said: 'I have been with Stacey through it all and it never even occurred that me that that's what it could be. The sisters are pictured  in 1997 . She has been told her tumour is not cancerous, and is classed as Grade 1, the lowest risk. However, her mother, Sharon Johnson, 47, is worried the tumour could grow and endanger her health. Mrs Johnson, a housekeeper, said: 'I thought it was a joke when they first told us, I just couldn't believe how this could happen to us again. 'They started to explain more about it and I realised it was nothing like Stacey's. 'Dannii's is at the front of her brain and Stacey's is right at the back.' They have now set up a charity providing days out for children with terminal illnesses . Doctors say Dannii does not need surgery yet, but Mrs Johnson said when Stacey was first diagnosed with a tumour, doctors believed it was benign. She wants Dannii to have the tumours removed, so that it cannot grow and turn into cancer. She said: 'First of all they said they would take it out, but then they did a biopsy and found it wasn't cancerous, so they have decided to monitor for the next few months. 'I am annoyed that they're not doing anything. 'Exactly the same thing happened with Stacey, they said it wasn't cancerous but then it grew within three months. 'If they just take it out now then it wouldn't have the chance to grow. 'They've said that surgery is dangerous and they only do it when absolutely necessary though.' In an effort to help others in the same situation, Stacey has set up a charity called ""Kisses for Kids"" providing days out for children with terminal or long term illness. The two sisters now spend their time fund-raising for it. Sarah Lindsell, chief executive of The Brain Tumour Charity, said: 'A brain tumour diagnosis is a huge shock for anyone. 'For a family to experience it twice is extraordinarily cruel and our hearts go out to the Johnsons. 'For the sake of all of those like Stacey and Dannii whose lives are turned upside down by a brain tumour, we are absolutely determined to improve treatments through research and raise awareness of this devastating disease.'","Stacey Johson, 22, was diagnosed with cancer in her brain eight years ago .

43,"Want to know what you'd look like if you hit the gym and shed a few pounds? Now you can, thanks to a new app that calculates a slimmer version of yourself - without having to do any exercise. ‘Visualize You’ processes an image of you to reveal what you'd look like if you were thinner - and perhaps inspire you to achieve your weight loss goal. Visual Health Studios in Colorado has developed a weight loss app called Visualize You. It calculates what you would look like if you lost a specified amount weight. Shown on the left is TV star James Corden at his current weight, 210lbs (95kg), and on the right he is seen after digitally losing 60lbs (27kg) A picture of Bridesmaids actress Melissa McCarthy at an event in February is shown on the left, and on the right the star is seen after digitally losing 50lbs (23lbs) Users are shown an original and a slimmer version, with a slider, so they can compare how they would look before and after losing weight. The app, which costs £1.61 ($2.40) on Android and £1.49 ($1.99) on iOS for the full version, has been developed by US company Visual Health Solutions Inc but with the assistance of major American hospitals. The makers say that it uses algorithms which show the effects of weight loss more effectively than other apps which stretch or pinch images. The app has been developed with the Wellness Institute of the Cleveland Clinic, the University of Colorado Anschutz Health and Wellness Centre, and UnitedHealthcare. Actor Jonah Hill, pictured in June 2014, is seen on the left at his normal weight, and on the right he is shown with a digital weight loss of 60lbs (27lbs) It asks you to enter your current height and weight and your target weight, giving you flexibility over how ambitious you want to be. Weight loss specialist Dr Charlie Seltzer told Yahoo Health: ‘Visual cues are very helpful for a lot of people. ‘I will often recommend that people put up pictures of what they want to look like or what they used to look like, provided the body image is healthy. ‘l’d hate for someone to put [their photo] in and see themselves not the way they are going to look, and get discouraged and disgruntled that they’re not changing how they’re supposed to. ‘But my first thought upon hearing about this app, was: ""It sounds like a really good idea.""' Charlie Lankston (lost 20lbs/9kg) Charlie Lankston is seen here before (left) and after (right) digitally losing 20lbs (9kg) 'At first, I thought it was great. The ""after"" picture looks pretty realistic, which I wasn’t actually expecting, and it was amazing to see what I could potentially look like with a few more trips to the gym! 'However, after thinking about it a bit more, I started feeling a slightly ashamed about the size of my actual face. 'Realistically, losing 20lbs is actually a pretty tough task, and the likelihood that I’ll be able to achieve it - and attain my ""skinny face"" - any time soon is pretty ""slim"" which doesn’t make me feel too great. 'Looks like it’s time to hit the treadmill…' Erica Tempesta (lost 38lbs/17kg) Erica Tempesta is seen here before before (left) and after (right) digitally losing 38lbs/17kg . 'It was cool to see such a dramatic difference, but I feel as though the app just changed the shape of my face, which isn’t necessarily how I would look nearly 40lbs lighter. 'My face has always been oval, regardless of my size. The app just made my face look longer as if my cheeks were sucked in. 'I chose a somewhat unrealistic target weight, but it was the size I had been in high school, so based on past pictures, I already had an idea of what my face should have looked like with less weight. 'I personally didn’t think the app gave a realistic rendering of weight loss.' The app allows you to take or upload a photo. You then need to enter your current height and weight, and then also enter your target weight. It will then enable you to 'scroll' through various weights on your way to your target, to see what you would look like . The app, which costs £1.61 ($2.40) on Android and £1.49 ($1.99) on iOS for the full version, has been developed by US company Visual Health Solutions Inc but with the assistance of major American hospitals. The makers say that it uses algorithms which show the effects of weight loss more effectively than other apps . Visualize You is effectively a reverse version of the popular app ‘Fat Booth’ in which users were able to see what they looked like if they were overweight.

44,"(CNN)""Hamlet."" ""Romeo and Juliet."" ""A Midsummer Night's Dream."" For centuries, these plays and three dozen more by William Shakespeare have formed history's most heralded literary canon. But now they may have to make room for an addition to Shakespeare's famous oeuvre. New research indicates that ""Double Falsehood,"" a play first published in 1728 by Lewis Theobald, was actually written more than a century earlier by Shakespeare himself with help from his friend John Fletcher. The findings were published this week by two scholars who used computer software to analyze the writings of the three men and compare it with the language of the ""newer"" play. ""The match between the 'Double Falsehood' play and Shakespeare was a landslide. It was shockingly clear,"" said Ryan L. Boyd, a researcher at the University of Texas at Austin. The study, co-authored by Boyd and UT colleague James W. Pennebaker, was published in the journal Psychological Science. ""There's very little wiggle room to interpret the numbers any differently."" Boyd said he and Pennebaker analyzed 33 plays by Shakespeare, nine by Fletcher and 12 by Theobald to create a ""psychological signature"" of each author based on word choices, phrase patterns and other factors. They compared those profiles to the language in ""Double Falsehood"" and determined that the play's first half was almost entirely written by Shakespeare, though the second half appeared to be split evenly between Shakespeare and Fletcher. Only tiny traces of Theobald's signature were found. ""We're certainly not suggesting that Theobald didn't make edits,"" Boyd told CNN. ""But he clearly did not write it."" ""Double Falsehood,"" also known as ""The Distressed Lovers,"" is based on the ""Cardenio"" section of Don Quixote, the classic 17th-century novel by Miguel de Cervantes. Set in Spain, the play revolves around the romantic entanglements of two brothers: one virtuous, one sinful. Theobald said he based the play on three original manuscripts he had discovered, all of them written by Shakespeare. But many scholars have long dismissed the play as a fake, suspecting that Theobald tried to pass the Bard's work off as his own. Shakespeare, who died in 1616, wrote most of his published plays between 1590 and 1612. British publishers Arden Shakespeare published ""Double Falsehood"" in 2010 -- for the first time in 250 years -- amid renewed claims by experts that it was Shakespeare's work. But the new study by Boyd and Pennebaker, the first to analyze the writings from a psychological perspective, may settle the matter once and for all. Shakespearean scholar Brean Hammond, professor of modern English literature at Nottingham University in the UK, praised the Texas study for its scientific approach. Hammond said Boyd and Pennebaker ""have got no dogs in the fight. They're not literary scholars, (so) their work could be seen as more objective than some of the literary studies."" Hammond studied ""Double Falsehood's"" authorship from a literary perspective five years ago and found Shakespeare's DNA evident in the play. But he doubts the new research will put the matter entirely to rest. ""Those people who don't believe the play was written by Shakespeare aren't going to just lay down and die,"" he said.","New research indicates that a play published in 1728 was written by William Shakespeare .

Research shows the first half of this play is entirely written by Shakespeare while the second half features contributions from both men. Despite some skepticism regarding its authenticity, experts agree that it's likely to be considered part of Shakespeare's literary canon henceforth.","New research suggests Shakespeare co-authored ""Double Falsehood,"" a play published in 1728. Computer analysis by researchers Ryan L. Boyd and James W. Pennebaker revealed strong linguistic similarities between ""Double Falsehood"" and Shakespeare's works, indicating his involvement alongside John Fletcher. The first half of the play appears to be primarily by Shakespeare, while the second half is attributed to both authors.  
","New research suggests 'Double Falsehood', a 1728 play, was actually written by William Shakespeare with John Fletcher's help. Computer analysis of language patterns confirms a strong match to Shakespeare's style, contradicting long-held doubts about the play's authorship.","New research suggests ""Double Falsehood"" was primarily written by William Shakespeare with contributions from John Fletcher.

This new study, using psychological analysis, offers compelling evidence supporting Shakespeare's authorship.

45,"You could be forgiven for thinking it was a perfectly sensible message about personal safety. But a police poster advising women to stick together on a night out provoked anger yesterday, as campaigners claimed it suggested victims were responsible for sex attacks. Sussex Police was accused of ‘victim-blaming’ in its campaign, which urges women not to leave their friends alone or let them wander off with strangers. Women’s rights groups said rapists were to blame for sex attacks, not their victims. Anti-rape campaigners have criticised the  message in this Sussex Police poster arguing it implies that victims are to blame for getting raped . But the poster won praise from supporters who said it was ‘blindingly obvious’ that it was not blaming women, and that it simply offered ‘sensible advice’. It features a picture of two smiling young women posing for a selfie, with the text: ‘Which one of your mates is most vulnerable on a night out? The one you leave behind.’ It goes on: ‘Many sexual assaults could be prevented. Stick together and don’t let your friend leave with a stranger or go off on their own.’ But anti-rape campaigners said police should target potential attackers instead, and that the poster sent a message that women needed a constant chaperone. Sarah Green, acting director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said she found the advice ‘infuriating’. She added: ‘We need to get beyond police campaigns giving instructions to women on how to behave to be safe. We need to talk to those who may perpetrate rape and deter them.’ Campaign: The posters are due to be put up in pub and club toilets as well as bus stops in Brighton (pictured) as well as other areas of Sussex . A pair of police officers watch on as University students gather on the street outside a bar in Brighton . Fabia Bates, of the Survivors’ Network, said: ‘Sussex Police has made great strides to encourage people to report sexual violence and there is the possibility this could damage people’s confidence. ‘We are here to support anyone who has been the victim and will not judge anyone – it is never the victim’s fault.’ Chief Inspector Katy Woolford said the police had a responsibility to advise potential victims on how to minimise risks . But David Davies, a former special constable who is running for re-election as Tory MP for Monmouth, said he thought the poster offered ‘common sense advice’, adding: ‘I don’t think it’s blaming victims ... it’s like telling people to lock car doors. I would say the same to young men, not to leave their mates behind in what could be a dangerous area because they could get robbed or sexually assaulted. ‘It’s disappointing that some groups don’t realise police are trying to help prevent problems. ‘No one’s suggesting the attacker doesn’t bear responsibility, the police are simply trying to make sure people are aware of danger and try to avoid it. It’s blindingly obvious.’ Clarence Mitchell, who is standing as the Tory candidate in Brighton Pavilion, agreed. ‘I’m quite sure that Sussex Police in no way intended to imply that women are somehow responsible for any attack,’ he said. ‘This is an entirely sensible campaign.’ Sussex Police said the posters would be put up at bus stops and in pub and nightclub toilets. Chief Inspector Katy Woolford said: ‘Rape is never a victim’s fault, but as with all crimes we can reduce the number of victims in several ways. ‘It is vital to be aware of vulnerability so that steps can be taken to guard against it.’ In 2012 West Mercia Police were forced to apologise for posters for its Safe Night Out initiative suggesting rape victims were to blame if they were drunk . Manchester Police were praised by anti-rape groups for their 2014 Christmas anti-rape campaign which carried the strapline: 'Drinking is not a Crime. Rape is' .","Sussex Police poster features two young women taking a selfie .

46,"In a hurry: Katrina Maddox, 23, with baby Edward, who was born in the back of an ambulance . In an unusual twist of fate, described as a 'million to one shot', a young mother has given birth in the back of an ambulance for the second time in as many years after her baby boy was born on the same stretch of busy main road as his brother. Katrina Maddox, 23, pulled off the double against all the odds after having baby Edward on the way to hospital in the early hours of last Thursday. Her second little boy came along on the A47 in Norfolk two years after Mrs Maddox, of North Pickenham, near Swaffham, had her first child Reuben in exactly the same way. The surprised mother said: 'I can't believe it's happened twice! 'I can't imagine there are many people who have both their children like this - it must be a million to one.' Mrs Maddox's labour with her first son, Reuben, was three hours long. The toddler, who is now two, ended up being delivered by his dad, Peter Maddox, 30, in the back of the ambulance as they were driven through North Tuddenham. Little Edward took just 72 minutes to arrive as the ambulance travelled past Longwater Retail Park at Costessey, Norwich. 'I really didn't want it to happen again and I was so adamant I was not going to have Edward in an ambulance,' laughed Mrs Maddox, who is training to be an accountant. 'But then it did get to that point when I realised I was not going to make it to the hospital again. 'At least this time Peter was able to be by my side rather than delivering his son himself.' Mrs Maddox, whose husband is a self-employed forester, added: 'I didn't even know I was in labour with my first son Reuben until I was pushing. 'Peter was an absolute saint and so calm for me. He was the best midwife I could have had. 'Both times everything happened so quickly I didn't even have time to panic or think about it.' This time the couple were at home in bed when Mrs Maddox realised Edward was on his way at about 3am. They knew they did not have time to hang around for Peter's parents to arrive. Luckily, a Good Samaritan neighbour popped in to look after Reuben as he slept upstairs, blissfully unaware of the second great baby drama unfolding. The route: This shows where both Reuben and Edward were born on the A47. Reuben came along near North Tuddenham and Edward as the ambulance travelled past Longwater Retail Park at Costessey, Norwich . Happy family: Edward followed in the footsteps of his brother Reuben (pictured), two, who was delivered by his father Peter Maddox as he and wife Katrina rushed to Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital . Mrs Maddox said she had considered it might have been easier to have a midwife go to her, but was told home births were not available in her area. The mum-of-two opted to go to Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital instead of Queen Elizabeth Hospital, King's Lynn, as she knows Norwich and the hospital far better. And the couple joke that they are old hands when it comes to registering an 'in transit' birth. Mrs Maddox, who grew up in nearby Saham Toney, said: 'For Reuben they had to put his place of birth as being in transit on the way to Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, at North Tuddenham, so I imagine it will be just the same for Edward.'","Katrina Maddox, 23, from Norfolk, said the odds must be 'a million to one'

47,"Mark Selby fell victim of the Crucible curse and a rookie Scot with pots of class as Anthony McGill pulled off a monumental Betfred World Championship shock. Qualifier McGill exuded calm assurance as he saw off the defending champion 13-9 to book a quarter-final place, never appearing overawed by the match or the gradual position of control he developed over the course of Friday. This is McGill's first World Championship and it had already been one to remember before he crossed cues with Selby, having beaten his fellow Glaswegian and sometime practice partner Stephen Maguire 10-9 in the opening round, finishing with a century. Anthony McGill celebrates beating Mark Selby during day seven of the Betfred World Championships . Sinking Selby made it even more special, and now the sky is the limit for the 24-year-old, who has been quietly earmarked for greatness by those who know him best. Former Crucible semi-finalist Alan McManus, a close friend and a steady hand on McGill's shoulder, has tipped the former Junior Pot Black runner-up to take the trophy in Sheffield one day, and Ronnie O'Sullivan said there would be no worthier champion because of his dedication. In 2005, Shaun Murphy came through qualifying and went on to lift the title. Tantalisingly Murphy could be next in line for McGill, a slender, shy man with a short ginger crop and a contagious giggle he often breaks into around the table. Selby, the Jester from Leicester, found little to laugh about during their contest. Like Murphy 10 years ago, McGill was a 150/1 outsider with bookmakers before the tournament began. McGill was the architect of Selby's demise, but the famous curse, which has at the very least become a factor lodged in the back of every first-time champion's mind, will be cited too. Selby (left) congratulates McGill on his victory during day seven of the Betfred World Championships . No maiden winner of the World Championship in Sheffield has returned a year later to retain the trophy, with Selby becoming the 16th man to falter, joining a list that includes greats of the game such as Steve Davis, Stephen Hendry and O'Sullivan. A steady opening session on Thursday had seen he and McGill reach 4-4, but the Scot stretched 10-6 clear by lunch on Friday after firing breaks of 56, 125 and 54, and there was no flinching from the outsider when play resumed in the evening. They shared the opening two frames, before 87 from McGill took him 12-7 clear, inflicting a mortal blow to Selby's prospects. McGill sets his sights on the white has he plays his way to victory against Selby at the Crucible . When Selby edged the next he at least had the thinking time the subsequent interval allowed, knowing he needed a further five frames without reply to extend his defence. He re-emerged with a break of 101 to make it 12-9 and keep McGill waiting. But not for long. After a safety battle, McGill potted a terrific red to the middle pocket and was away on a victory charge, firing in a brilliant 82 before Selby offered a warm handshake. McGill said: 'I'm just ecstatic. To beat the world champion at the Crucible, I just can't believe it . 'No-one expected me to win. I wasn't expecting myself to win, I was just hoping to put up a decent fight and try my best. Selby's facial expressions say iy all as he crashes out of the World Championship at the Crucible . 'I knew if I gave everything my mind would have been at ease whatever the result . 'To beat Mark 13-9 is just a dream. I knew it wasn't over even when it went 12-7. He's not world champion for nothing. 'Time and time again Mark Selby comes back at people, and better players than me. 'It seems like every time I win a game it's the biggest win of my career. Fingers crossed it keeps happening.' McGill will be careful not to let his mind drift beyond a last-eight clash with Murphy or Joe Perry, who begin their second-round clash on Sunday. Snooker player Selby in action against Anthony McGill during day seven of the Betfred World Championships . 'I've knocked out the world champion, so you think whoever knocks him out could (win the title) - but I don't know,' McGill said. 'It's going all right but I'm not winning enough frames in one visit. There's a few areas I need to brush up on before I start thinking about those things. 'I don't think people will be fearing me. 'I'm probably a good draw in the quarter-finals of the World Championship to be honest. I'll just go out and try my best. 'Some players might let the attention get to their head but not me.'

48,"Dustin Wayne South died in Louisville, Kentucky, on Wednesday after police were called to a field where South was seen wielding a gun . A 32-year-old man shot himself in the head during a firefight with police officers in Kentucky as horrified witnesses watched the chaotic scene unfold. Dustin Wayne South died Wednesday night at the Louisville scene, in a field behind Lassiter Middle School, a normally peaceful neighborhood in the southern part of the city. The shootout occurred after a neighbor saw South walking around the field while waving a gun in the air. Two bullets fired by police struck South, but neither was lethal, said Jo-Ann Farmer, chief deputy coroner. He died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. Cherylyan Rayhel said she watched from a window as South waved a gun and fired into the air just behind her house about 8pm, which is when she reported the situation to the police. Officers yelled three times for him to drop the gun, but instead he raised it and pointed it at them, she said. Gunfire erupted. She did not see the man turn the gun on himself. 'I saw him fall; I screamed,' Rayhel said Thursday morning. 'I haven't slept all night.' The Louisville Metro Police Department identified the officers involved as Rondall Carpenter and Zachary Cooke. The officers have been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of an internal investigation. This is the second fatal shoot involving Carpenter in less than a year. Last October, he and another officer, Skylar Graudick, were involved in a shooting that killed 38-year-old William Chad Mattingly, who had allegedly fired on the officers. Louisville Metro Police officers Rondall Carpenter (left) and Zachary Cooke (right) were involved in a shootout with South, but South eventually shot himself in the head . The shooting remains under review with the commonwealth's attorney. On Wednesday night, Rayhel said she saw South fighting with a woman in the street in front of her house, just around the corner from South's home. South, weeping, hugged a young boy who was with the couple and turned to leave, Rayhel said. The boy tried to chase him, but the woman held him back. Neighbors described South as friendly and sweet. Sherri Reynolds said she often saw him in the neighborhood, playing with a little boy. But she said he'd recently seemed troubled. Last week, he went out for a drive 'to clear his emotions,' he would later tell police. Before police arrived on scene, a neighbor said that she saw South fighting with a woman in the street in front of her house . He 'was unaware of his surroundings' and careened his truck off Northwestern Parkway in Shawnee, according to court records. He slid down a hill into the Shawnee Golf Course. He tried to drive through the golf course to find an exit, but got stuck in the mud, damaging a green as he tried to drive free. South was cited for criminal mischief and scheduled to appear in court for arraignment later this month. In May 2014, he was arrested on allegations of domestic assault. His wife told police he came home drunk, became aggressive and pushed her 14-year-old daughter out of his way. She got between them, she said, and he pushed her into a countertop. He pleaded guilty days later to the lesser charge of harassment with physical contact. He completed alcohol treatment and domestic violence programs, and the court set aside the conviction. Officers yelled at South to put down the gun when they arrived on scene, but instead he pointed it at them before turning it on himself . Rayhel, who just moved to the neighborhood, did not know South. After he walked away from the confrontation with the woman, he disappeared around her house, noticeably agitated, toward a field between her backyard and the middle school. Alone and frightened, she ran to her kitchen window that overlooks the field. She saw him wave a gun around and fire several times. It was close enough to rattle her windows, she said. She called 911 around 8pm and pleaded for help. Officers arrived minutes later, she said. Rayhel called her mother, still watching from her window as the officers closed in on South. They yelled for him to drop his gun. Shawn Jones, an eighth-grader, was with two friends behind the school when he heard the commotion and saw the man waving the handgun in the air. The man kept firing into the sky, he said. The officers yelled a second time for him to drop the gun, Rayhel said. She told her mother she was afraid they were going to kill him in her backyard. 'Baby, just look away,' she recalls her mother telling her. The officers shouted for the man to drop his gun a third time and Rayhel looked back up as gunshots rang out and South slumped to the ground. The coroner on Thursday formally ruled his death a suicide. The incident, in which shots were fired by both the police and South, occurred outside a middle school at about 8pm on Wednesday .","Police were called after a neighbor saw South walking through a field behind a Louisville middle school while pointing a gun in the air .

49,"The family of a former art teacher who died from lung cancer after years of pinning pupils' work to classroom walls lined with asbestos has taken legal action against the local council. Jennifer Barnett worked Archway School in Stroud, Gloucestershire, between 1980 and 1997, when she left teaching to have her fourth child. The 60-year-old died last September, 14 months after she was diagnosed with mesothelioma - a cancer whose most common cause is asbestos. Loved: Jennifer Barnett worked Archway School in Stroud, Gloucestershire, between 1980 and 1997, when she left teaching to have her fourth child. Above, the mother-of-four with her husband and children . Her husband, Nigel, told an inquest into her death in January that his wife had to cut sheets of asbestos while working on a farm in her 20s. 'She then became an art teacher and from 1977 until 1995 worked at various schools, often hanging paintings on walls containing asbestos,' he added. The coroner, Katy Skerrett, recorded a verdict of death as a result of industrial disease. A post-mortem found a large tumour in her right lung. Ms Skerrett said: 'It is clear that there was sufficient exposure to asbestos in her occupation for me to reach a conclusion that this lady died from an industrial disease.' Mr Barnett and his family believe the asbestos in the school is to blame for Mrs Barnett's death and are now taking legal action against Gloucestershire County Council. In a statement released this week, Mr Barnett said that during her time as a teacher, his wife also did clay modelling with pupils and the cupboard where the clay was stored also contained asbestos. He said: 'Jen was a fantastic wife and a wonderful mother to our four children. She was so precious to us and it is hard to believe she's gone. 'Prior to her illness, she was a very fit and healthy 60-year old who enjoyed playing tennis in her spare time and was a dedicated and extremely talented artist who continued to work right up until her death. 'Our youngest daughter was only 18 when her mum passed away and was just about to start university. 'The whole family misses her dreadfully and we are all shocked and devastated that her life was cut short so suddenly.' Mrs Barnett worked at Archway School, where she was known as Miss Shonk, as an art teacher before being promoted head of the department. She left teaching aged 42 to have her youngest daughter, but continued to work as an artist. Her family said she remained positive during 'gruelling' chemotherapy treatment, but died the day after celebrating her 30th wedding anniversary, in September 2014. Dedicated: For 17 years, Mrs Barnett worked at Archway School, in Stroud, Gloucestershire, pictured, where she was known as Miss Shonk, as an art teacher before being promoted head of the department . Mr Barnett said: 'I'll never forget the consultant at the hospital asking Jen if she'd ever been exposed to asbestos and her saying a definite ""yes"" because she knew a lot of asbestos was previously used in school buildings. 'Jen fought the cancer bravely and remained positive throughout gruelling sessions of chemotherapy. 'The day before she died, she even managed to come to the little village church where we were married to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary and we had a very special day together as a family. 'Photographs taken that day show her smiling and we will always treasure them.' Mr Barnett, from Painswick, Gloucestershire, has instructed specialist asbestos disease lawyers at Novum Law to investigate his wife's working conditions at the school. He added: 'I am hoping former teachers or ex-pupils will come forward who may have some knowledge about the asbestos ceiling tiles at Archway School or know of any other asbestos products or materials that were used there.' Helen Grady, an asbestos disease solicitor at Novum Law said: 'It is alarming that we are seeing more and more cases involving teachers. 'Asbestos was widely used in the UK as a building material for fireproofing and insulation from the 1950s up until 1985, when most types were banned. 'It was banned completely from new buildings in 1999 but, sadly the damage had already been done for thousands of victims who have paid the ultimate price for going to work every day. 'We hope anyone who may have attended Archway or worked there remembers Jen and can shed more light on how she got exposed.'

51,"(CNN)If you're famous and performing the American national anthem, be prepared to become a national hero or a national disgrace. Facts are facts.  Just ask Vince, Whitney, Roseanne, Jimi and Michael. Mötley Crüe's Vince Neil reminded us again this week of the dangers of tackling ""The Star-Spangled Banner."" Sure, he can shred it on ""Girls, Girls, Girls"" and ""Dr. Feelgood,"" but this is a different story -- a completely different story. To say Neil butchered the song before the Las Vegas Outlaws Arena Football League game would be unkind to those in the profession.  There's less carnage when butchers are done with their work. The late Whitney Houston set the modern standard for the national anthem at Super Bowl XXV.  In the early stages of the Gulf War in 1991, a patriotic America saluted her performance. Just six months earlier, comedian Roseanne Barr may have established the low-water mark. The crowd at the San Diego Padres game booed her rendition and President George H. W. Bush called it ""disgraceful."" There's nothing quite like getting the presidential thumbs down. One of the most controversial and beloved versions of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" comes from 1969. Guitar slinger Jimi Hendrix inflamed mainstream America with his psychedelic take on the national anthem to the delight of the Woodstock generation. And then there's Michael Bolton's version.  Overly wrought songs are his specialty and he doesn't disappoint in that department when he sings at the American League Championship Series in 2003.  Bolton belts it out, but there's one little problem -- the words.  Can anyone say crib notes?","Singing the national anthem is a risky proposition .
Whitney Houston nailed it; Roseanne Barr destroyed it .",18," ""Infamous national anthem performances include Vince Neil (Las Vegas Outlaws), Whitney Houston (Super Bowl XXV), Roseanne Barr (San Diego Padres), Jimi Hendrix, Michael Bolton, and George H.

52,"A Russian woman indundated with vicious and homophobic messages for running a support group for LGBT teenagers, has publicly shamed her trolls by posting their identities online. Elena Klimova, 26, who runs Children 404 - an online support group for  young people about coming out and dealing with discrimination - regularly receives obscene hate-filled rants from strangers telling her she's 'disgusting' and should kill herself. The activist fought back by publishing the messages on VKontakte, the Russian equivalent of Facebook, under the title: 'Beautiful People And The Things They Say To Me'. Elena Klimova managed to track down the social media accounts of many of her trolls, and has posted their vile messages along with candid photos of each sender (pictured) to a Russian website called VKontakte . Comments include one from a man who told her: You f****** animal, delete your f****** LGBT group.' A woman named Yulia sent Elena a particularly vitriolic message. 'Hello, Lena. My f*g brother... is one of your friends online, so I have a request for you, teach him not to show his f***** tendencies when he comes to family gatherings. 'He will never be accepted by anyone in our family as a f**, so he can sit and shut up.' Elena posted this message along with a photo of Yulia grinning and posing with a bunch of wild flowers. While Elena has revealed the faces of the people her trolls, MailOnline has blurred them. Elena Klimova (pictured) is a Russian activist for the LGBT (Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender) community who receives a vast volume of hate mail . 'You f*****g animal, delete your f*****g LGBT group,' one man wrote to Elena, which she rather poignantly posted with a photo of said man holding an outstretched cat (pictured) 'As beautiful people write to me often, this album will be continually updated,' Klimova wrote on her VKontakte page, according to Buzzfeed. 'It was created for the enjoyment of contrasts and the diversity of life.' The name of Elena's group, Children 404, is a reference to the 'page not found' online error notice and Russia’s law banning 'gay propaganda' among minors. One of the website's slogans is 'LGBT Teens: We Exist.' Another message, this time from a man named Dmitry, referred to homosexuals as 'libidinous f****** perverts'. In Dmitry's photo, he is seen with his arm affectionately around the shoulders of a female companion. This woman (pictured) wrote, 'Hello, Lena. My f*g brother... is one of your friends online. He will never be accepted by anyone in our family as a f*g, so he can sit and shut up' Elena dubbed the album, 'Beautiful People And The Things They Say To Me' Another message (pictured), this time from a man named Dmitry (right), referred to homosexuals as 'libidinous f****** perverts' Another troll wrote: 'You think you’re helping anything with this holy crusade?? Go and f****** kill yourself before they come for you!!! People like you should be locked up!' Several people called Elena 'disgusting' and said she would 'burn in hell' for supporting the rights of the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) community. Although homosexual relationships in Russia were decriminalised in 1993, discrimination still runs rampant. In June 2013, Russian lawmakers in Moscow passed a new law banning the 'propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships' to minors.

53,"Teenagers across America got a very realistic simulation of a prom night drinking and driving crash and from the looks of their aghast faces it seems as though they learned their lesson.

Nau's brother, Austin, died at age 17 in a 2011 non-alcohol-related automobile accident. Playing one of the injured students was Alanni Young who was sprayed with makeup that realistically looked like blood.

'Thank God it’s not real,' said Kelly Hastings, who played the dead woman, told CBS. 'I couldn’t imagine seeing a scene like that, although I couldn’t see it because I was participating in it. I just pray to God it never happens to anyone else.' The drunken driving crash simulation didn't end at the collision. Real first-responders came to the scene with their sirens blasting. Fire trucks, ambulances, and even medevac helicopters took the actors playing victims away as though they were truly hurt. 'We’re actually showing first-hand what a motor vehicle accident looks like from start to finish,' said Massapequa fire fighter Stuart Paolino. Injured victim: 'Thank God it’s not real,' said Kelly Hastings, who played the dead woman, told CBS . The simulation was Paolino's idea and he hopes it will scare teenagers out of drinking and driving. The man who played the drunk driver, Brian Bernhard, was escorted off the scene in handcuffs. Bernhard told CBS even though it was just a simulation, he felt absolutely terrified and hopes that no one has to go through a drunken driving arrest. 'It felt like the real thing,' he said. 'It certainly, certainly was no joke; very real.' Students who witnessed the gruesome play acting were left with stunned expressions on their faces. It was a little scary to see what could actually happen, and it hit me,' said Massapequa High School junior Jacob Liese. 'This simulation, along with consistent reinforcement of the importance of healthy choices, is an invaluable opportunity to positively impact our students in our fight against DWI and other destructive decisions,' said Lucille F.

'I'm talking from my experience and I can say that Sinisa's a man of great sensitivity, a great professional and a great worker. 'He arrives two hours before training and he leaves two hours after.

Kovacic wrote in an email: 'In the two years leading up to this incident, [the ex] made it her personal mission to make Elena's life miserable. 'She routinely harassed and threatened to hurt Elena, stole from her, and cruelly plotted to drag [the boyfriend] back into addiction. 'That's one silver lining -  she's [Curtin] been able to examine how bad (her relationship) was and move on with her life.'

He said: 'He was the only one I told at the team meeting this morning that he will play, so he knows. 'Definitely they missed him because he did not play for 10 or 11 games. He had 10 weeks out - that's quite a long time. 'He is the controller of the team and a player with experience, so for the team it is good, not only as a player, but also as a person, that he's back in the team.' Cattermole's return could hardly be more timely with Sunderland sitting just a point clear of the Barclays Premier League relegation zone with eight games to play and in desperate need of a repeat of their heroics at the end of last season if they are to avoid another desperate scrap for top-flight survival. Advocaat and coach Paul Bracewell discuss tactics during training ahead of the clash with Newcastle . Cattermole and his team-mates share a joke during training as they prepare to face their fiercest rivals . Former Middlesbrough and Wigan man Cattermole played his part in a remarkable escape 12 months ago, and while he insists the picture has not been as black as has been painted at times, he knows the time for action rather than talking has arrived. Cattermole said: 'We haven't played too badly all season, really. There's been the odd bad performance which has killed us, but we just need to start getting over the line and winning some games. There's not really much else to say on the matter. 'We need to get some confidence. We haven't hit a roll all season, we did at the end of last season. It's always been a draw, a draw, then maybe a win, and we have never got anything going. Cattermole played his part in a remarkable escape from relegation for the Black Cats just 12 months ago . Cattermole has yet again missed large portions of Sunderland's season through injury . 'This is a good time to maybe get something going and finish the season with a bit of a bang.' Cattermole has played in two of Sunderland's four consecutive wins over their neighbours, including the 1-0 victory at St James' Park in December, and an extension of that record would send spirits soaring on Wearside. The Black Cats have never before enjoyed five wins on the trot over the Magpies, but while acknowledging the importance of the fixture, Advocaat - a veteran of the Old Firm derby as well as similar rivalries in Holland and Russia - is refusing to be distracted by the opposition this weekend. He said: 'It's nice, but the past doesn't count anymore. We don't get more points because of the last four games. Will Buckley and some of the Sunderland squad share the ball around during a training session . Sunderland players battle for the ball as the Black Cat prepare of their clash against Newcastle United . Jermain Defoe teases the Sunderland players as he dummies a pass in training at the Academy of Light . 'We all know how important this is, it's a special moment for everybody. But we are focused on the game and that we get the result we need. 'Every game for us is a special match. This, of course, because it's Newcastle is special, but we still need points and we still have only eight games left, so in that way, it's very important that we can show our fans that we really want to win. 'If we can get them behind us, it can be a very important weapon.' While Advocaat has been boosted by Cattermole's return, he will be without central defender Wes Brown, who faces up to a month on the sidelines with a knee injury.

59,"Bryony Hibbert (pictured), 25,  the girlfriend of the footballer caught having drunken sex in the dugout, has slammed those responsible for the clip . This is the first picture of the girlfriend of the semi-professional footballer caught having drunken sex with a female supporter in the dugout after his team's 4-1 defeat. Striker Jay Hart, 24, could be heard laughing on the mobile phone footage as he was caught romping with the mystery blonde in his club T-shirt with his tracksuit bottoms around his legs. He was dismissed after the sex clip of his tryst at Mossley AFC in Tameside was shared on social media and has now begged for his 25-year-old girlfriend Bryony Hibbert's forgiveness. The 73rd minute substitute for non-league Clitheroe FC, in Lancashire, today admitted he had no idea who the woman was and reached out to Wayne Rooney on Twitter for advice. Speaking for the first time since he was caught in the act, he said: 'All I want say is that I regret doing what I did. 'I was drunk, I'd had more than a few drinks, and I want to say I'm sorry to my family and everyone involved at Clitheroe. 'I regret that I did it, not that I got caught. 'I've spoken and tried to sort things out with Bryony . 'Everyone in the world knows about it, I just want to get my apology out there. 'I haven't seen the girl since, I don't have a clue who she is, don't have a clue.' His team had just suffered a 4-1 defeat at Mossley's Seel Park stadium in the final game of the season which was billed as a 'ladies day' to attract more female supporters. The face of the blonde fan cannot be seen in the close-up footage. Hart was sacked by the club, which play in Evo-Stik Division 1 North, within hours of the footage being shared to fans. His girlfriend Bryony Hibbert, from Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, who has two young children, slammed those responsible for filming and sharing the clip. Writing on the Clitheroe Football Club Facebook page, she said: 'Have a bit of decency for the people it's affected. Thank God my kids are too young to read. It's disgusting. I bet their families are far from perfect.' Striker Jay Hart could be heard laughing on the mobile phone footage as he was caught romping with blonde . One person who saw the film, which was shared on Twitter and Instagram, said Mr Hart was unaware he was being filmed at first. He said: 'The camera came round the dugout and there was a blonde female with her head down. The man couldn't see the camera because his eyes were closed. 'After a few seconds, he opened his eyes and laughed and the camera panned away again. I've been to Mossley AFC a few times and it's clearly their ground. The whole clip is only 10 to 15 seconds.' Mr Hart said he thinks of Ms Hibbert's  children as his own and hasn't seen them since the incident. His mother, Dawn Hart 46, also revealed Jay's younger sisters have been targeted by trolls, with someone sending the video to the youngest, aged nine. 'I know he's done wrong, but at the end of the day, he's my son and to see what people are saying about him, it's not nice,' she said. Mr Hart could be heard laughing on the mobile phone footage as he was caught romping with the mystery blonde . 'People have done a lot worse. Someone sent the video to my girls as well. 'They know something's gone on but they don't know what exactly, and to have to explain it to them when someone sends them something like that is horrible. 'It's had a knock on effect on his girls as well.' Clitheroe chairwoman Anne Barker said the player had 'brought the club into disrepute'. She said: 'I can't have somebody wearing the Clitheroe FC tracksuit bringing us down. 'It has brought the club into disrepute and it's not proper for him to scupper our reputation. I expect our players to act professionally. 'It was brought to my attention on Saturday night and dealt with through the management. I did offer to speak to him myself but Simon (Garner, the manager) said he would take care of it.' Mr Hart previously played for Colne FC and Padiham FC before joining Clitheroe, who currently sit 14th in the Evo-Stik League First Division North. First team manager Simon Garner, who signed Mr Hart, said: 'At the time of this unfortunate occurrence on Saturday, I wasn't there. I had already left the ground. 'I found out later on when I saw how it played out in Twitter. I'm disappointed but we can't control what the players do outside the time we are with them. 'They choose what they want to do. Unfortunately, Jason was wearing the club tracksuit and he knows he has let the club down, so the club has done what it has done. 'He's disappointed it has gone this far. It's going to have consequences for him beyond leaving this football club; with his family and possibly beyond that. 'Football is only a small part of it. If he had thought about what would have happened when he did it, he wouldn't have done it. He will pay for it. 'When I spoke to him, he sounded very apologetic about it. I'm disappointed for him. He will regret what he did and it was totally wrong.' No-one from Mossley AFC was available for comment yesterday.

60,"Britain has overtaken France to become the second biggest economy in Europe, figures showed yesterday. The UK clocked up growth of 2.8 per cent in 2014 – the strongest in the Group of Seven industrialised nations and seven times higher than France’s 0.4 per cent. According to an International Monetary Fund report, this was enough for Britain to leapfrog socialist France and become the second most powerful economy in Europe, behind Germany. The UK is expected to cement its position in the coming years as one of the fastest growing major economies in the West. The IMF is forecasting ‘solid’ growth of 2.7 per cent this year and 2.3 per cent in 2016. Scroll down for video . The UK clocked up growth of 2.8 per cent in 2014 – the strongest in the Group of Seven industrialised nations . Despite a slight downgrade for 2016 – the IMF’s initial forecast was 2.4 per cent – this is still enough for Britain to leave other EU nations trailing in its wake. Output in France is forecast to expand by 1.2 per cent this year and 1.5 per cent next year, while Germany is set to grow by 1.6 per cent then 1.7 per cent. Within the G7, only the US is expected to perform better than Britain. ‘In the United Kingdom, lower oil prices and improved financial market conditions are expected to support continued steady growth,’ the IMF said. The World Economic Outlook report, which was published yesterday, will be seen as a boost for the Conservatives ahead of next month’s General Election. The Fund also appeared to back Tory plans to return Britain to the black after years of borrowing and rising debt. It will come as another blow to Labour leader Ed Miliband who has pledged to bring traditionally Left-wing policies back to Britain – mirroring the actions of Francois Hollande in France. The French president swept to power in 2012 promising to take on the rich and big business, but the country’s economy has been in a rut ever since. Unemployment in France is 10.6 per cent compared to 5.7 per cent in Britain. George Osborne, left, said the recovery would be put at serious risk by a Labour government, as IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard, right, warned that debt levels are 'very high' in many European countries . George Osborne used last month’s Budget to boast that Yorkshire has created more jobs than the whole of France. The Chancellor yesterday said the recovery would be put at serious risk by a Labour government propped up by the Scottish National Party. ‘These IMF growth forecasts for the UK are further proof our economic plan is working,’ he said. ‘So we must finish the job.’ IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard warned that debt levels are ‘very high’ in many European countries and said ‘it would be desirable to decrease them’.","The UK has overtaken France after seeing growth of 2.8 per cent in 2014 .

61,"Tucked along the coastline of the second smallest country in South America, the tiny fishing village of Jose Ignacio is almost unknown around the world. But every summer, this sleepy backwater hosts the creme de la creme of the fashion world, celebrities and more than a few millionaire playboys. Staying in shabby chic cottages or sleek hotels overlooking the sea, they converge of the beach - a mass of honeyed limbs and perfect figures stretched out in the sun while planning where to party that night. The tiny village of Jose Ignacio is an understated getaway for the rich and famous, filed with pretty villas and sleek beach huts . Rolling Stone Ronnie Wood (left) and Colombian singer Shakira (right) are among the stars said to have escaped the spotlight by holidaying in the chic resort of Jose Ignacio . So, what has brought everyone from Colombian singer Shakira to Rolling Stone Ronnie Wood and restaurateur and playboy Giuseppe Cipriani - the man behind the glamorous Cipriani restaurants dotted around the world's most stylish cities - to these shores? Wedged between oversized neighbours Argentina and Brazil, Uruguay has largely stayed off the radar for European and American travellers, but has long been a favourite summer spot for South Americans thanks to its endless golden beaches and low prices. With an area of just 68,000 square miles, the country's sizeable Atlantic coastline is home to pretty villages, two major cities - the capital Montevideo and the glorious colonial Portuguese town of Colonia - while the interior is dotted with little more than estancia farms breeding cattle and growing wine. Each summer (during the American and European winter), Uruguay's beaches are taken over by well-heeled Brazilians and Argentinians looking for good food and sunshine. Even the luxury boutiques selling trinkets alongside designer products are designed in the shabby chic beach style . La Huella is one of the most famous restaurants in Jose Ignacio and a favourite with holidaymakers for its relaxed beach atmosphere . As telenovela (soap opera) actresses and Latin film stars descended on the coast, one resort in particular became the haunt of the rich and famous. Punta del Este, about 85 miles east of Montevideo, was soon known as the Miami of South America, with sumptuous hotels, pop-up restaurants run by celebrity chefs and visitors ranging from supermodels and actors to company CEOs. There are so many celebrity homes in the area that there has actually been a bus tour launched, much like the ones in LA and New York. And Punta del Este even has its own area called Beverly Hills. Naomi Campbell has visited, as have British and Spanish royalty, footballer Diego Maradona has a house nearby and even former US president George Bush has stayed. Locals and visitors stay understated in their beachwear (left) and the entrance of the village itself is posted with colourful signs by the side of the sandy roads . The dark-tiled pool perfectly reflects the sky and blends in with the sea beyond at the exclusive Playa Vik hotel . While the golden beaches of Uruguay are the main draw for Argentinian and Brazilian visitors, but those coming from further afield may want to combine Jose Ignacio and Punta del Este with some other hotspots. Colonia del Sacramento is perhaps Uruguay's prettiest town, with cobbled streets and crumbling buildings left over from Portuguese and Spanish rule . Colonia del Sacramento sits across the Rio de la Plata from Argentina (Buenos Aires is just an hour away by ferry). Owing its heritage to a mix of Portuguese and Spanish colonialism - the two battled over its strategic location - it is a maze of pretty cobbled streets, bougainvillea-draped buildings and a crumbling lighthouse with panoramic views. The picture-perfect spot is doesn't take long to explore but is ideal for a couple of lazy days strolling the streets, eating in patio restaurants and enjoying the atmosphere. The capital Montevideo tends to divide opinion among travellers. Some blast the city for its high-rise buildings and lack of colonial charm (at least when compared to nearby Colonia). But the quirky capital does have some of the buzz of its rival across the water Buenos Aires, with a beautiful 19th century market near the port crammed with restaurants serving asado (barbecue beef) and endless bottles of wine. The city has a necklace of beaches which come alive in the summer time with events and eateries and there is a faded beauty in the crumbling towers and Art Deco buildings of the city. Tango bars and theatres have combined to give the city a reputation as a true cultural hub in Uruguay. If you want to head away from the cities, then travel inland to the various estancias (ranches) that dominate the country's interior. There is a good business in rural tourism here, with estancias offering stays to visitors - ranging from the basic to the super-luxurious - and the chance to ride gaucho-style on horses through the countryside, learn about their culture and tuck into the freshest asado beef there is. Website www.welcomeuruguay.com has some options listed. With so many big names rubbing shoulders in one town, it is on wonder the ultra-chic crowd started to head elsewhere for some peace and quiet - which is how they happened upon tiny Jose Ignacio, just 22 miles east along the coast. Happen upon it on a quiet day and you would never know how popular it is. The tarmac road gives way to sand at the entrance of the village, pretty clapboard houses probably look more elegant than most, and signs pointing to chic boutiques and eateries are subtle. In the centre of the village is a simple square decorated with colourful flowers. There are no high rises, no gaudy luxury hotels, just an assortment of those shabby chic-style buildings that make the perfect romantic backdrop for fashion shoots - something which is not lost on the fashion directors of the world's glossiest magazines, who flock to the area to create stylish beach spreads. The hotels in the area hide behind walls and fences, leaving them almost invisible to the average visitor, while at the same time showcasing spectacular ocean views to their guests, taking advantage of the village's location on a peninsula jutting out to sea. The suites sit in individual huts covered in grass and wildflowers and the bedrooms boast spectacular views out to sea from the floor-to-ceiling windows . The central titanium and glass structure was designed as a sculpture and the back opens up onto the terrace and infinity pool . From the restaurant, guests can stroll out on to the terrace and sit by the pool which blends in with the sea beyond . One such sleek addition is Playa Vik, built by Norwegian-born hotelier Alex Vik, it is a sleek modern design which shouldn't work with the traditional ambience of the village but somehow does. Virgin Holidays Worldwide Journeys offers a 17-day Best of South America trip from £3,829pp. The trip includes return flights from London Heathrow to Lima and returning from Rio de Janeiro, accommodation and sightseeing encompassing Lima, Yucay, Machu Picchu, Cusco, Puno, Iguassu Falls, Buenos Aires and Rio de Janeiro. Price is based on two adults sharing a standard room on a mixed board basis and includes sightseeing with experienced English-speaking guides and transfers. An additional trip to Uruguay can be added into the itinerary at an extra cost. Stone and glass huts sit under grass roofs dotted with wildflowers, blending them in with their surroundings and are organised in a circle around a central grassy area. Inside, huge stone baths and showers give the bathroom a rustic feel, while the huge bedrooms have quirky quotes scrawled across them (a favourite is: 'May the fleas of a thousand camels infest the crotch of the person who screws up your day and may their arms be too short to scratch'). The floor-to-ceiling windows provide spectacular ocean views to those lucky enough to enjoy the end properties, and there are more chances to contemplate the seascape from the rooms on the top floor of the main building - a huge rectangular titanium and glass structure designed as an enormous sculpture. Paintings hang on every wall, a cosy library gives way to a grand open room used as a casual restaurant throughout the day and evening, but the showstopper is the missing fourth wall, leading out to decking and a narrow infinity swimming pool, complete with dark tiling, which juts straight out towards the sea and is illuminated with star-like lights at night. By day, guests languidly swim while looking out to sea and across the golden sands and in the evening, the terrace is the perfect place to watch the sun go down while enjoying a glass of Uruguayan wine. It may not be as famous as its Argentine neighbour, but the beef and wine in Uruguay is just as fabulous (just don't say that to an Argentinian). During my stay, bankers, fashion designers and movie executives mingle over fresh breakfasts, discuss their plans to explore further afield and generally create a convivial atmosphere so very different from the hugs nameless, faceless hotels often found at beach resorts. Chic beach houses are the order of the day in Jose Ignacio, with understated clapboard getting a modern twist and beach attire very much on the casual side . Uruguayan painter Carlos Paez Vilaro created this fairy tale home Casapueblo in Punta del Este perched on a clifftop and looking out to sea - visitors can tor the quirky property today and learn more about the artist or stay in the part of it converted into a hotel . Playa Vik has been such a success that down the road Estancia Vik has recently opened, providing a grander, more traditional atmosphere with its luxurious 'farmhouse', but it has a similar atmosphere to its siter hotel, created by spectacular works of art on every wall, fantastic food and a personalised service (I never meet a member of staff who doesn't greet me by name). For those looking for more than relaxation on the beach, the estancia offers the chance to ride horses through the countryside like a gaucho and take to the local rivers in a kayak. The best eateries frequented by the great and good are the stylish but casual dining options on the beach. Mostrador Santa Teresita was set up by Argentinian chef Fernando Trocca, serving fresh seafood and glorious salads. Parador La Huella is one of the most popular restaurants in town and opens with the same staff every year, serving only local produce and spectacular asados (barbecues), while La Susana also boasts a beautiful beach spot and has long been famed for its glorious barbecued meat paired with wines.","Jose Ignacio is a tiny fishing village on the Atlantic coast of Uruguay - the smallest country in South America .

62,"A dismembered body discovered at a flat in Wales has been identified as Tracey Woodford, police said, as a man was arrested over her murder. The 47-year-old is believed to have been attacked in woodland in Pontypridd on Tuesday before being taken back to the property of a man she is thought to have left a town centre pub with, officers said. Her body was discovered with 'massive injuries' around 3pm on Friday afternoon, prompting police to launch a murder investigation. A man named locally as Christopher May, 50, has been arrested. Police confirmed yesterday they had been given an extra 36 hours to question the suspect. Scroll down for video . A dismembered body discovered at a flat in Wales has been identified as Tracey Woodford (above) who has been missing since Tuesday, police revealed . Ms Woodford was last seen by her family at around 12.45pm on April 21 in Rhydyfelin. She was reported missing the next day and her body was discovered after police received information she was with a man at the Skinny Dog pub for around two hours that night and left the premises with him. A police spokesman said: 'Police officers then visited the suspect's address and, following a search of the property, discovered a body. The suspect was arrested on suspicion of murder. 'A 50-year-old man remains in police custody and is assisting police with our enquiries.' After discovering the body police cordoned off an area surrounding nearby Pontypridd Rugby Club's Sardis Road stadium and officers were seen searching the undergrowth. At least four South Wales Police vans and one helicopter took part in the operation, prompting speculation from local residents. Detective Superintendent Paul Hurley described the events surrounding Ms Woodford's death as 'tragic'.

He added that police want to speak to anybody who thinks they may have information that can help the investigation. They are particularly interested in those who noticed anything suspicious near Andrews Court, Rickards Street, or near the rugby ground. 'No matter how insignificant the information may seem, we would like people to contact us,' he said. 'We have a team of detectives and the support of specialist resources working on this inquiry and while we understand it will alarm the community, this is an isolated incident and we do have somebody in custody.' Police have cordoned off an area surrounding Pontypridd Rugby Club, near to where the body was found . Neighbours at the flat complex are shocked at the latest updates. One said: 'It is just too shocking to think about. You dread to think about that poor woman and what she went through.' Another added: 'Tracey had her problems over the years but she was loved by her family. 'No-one deserves to die like this. It doesn’t bear thinking about.'

63,"The first dramatic footage of the Hatton Garden jewellery heist shows how the gang returned twice in three days to continue their audacious robbery  - as it is revealed police may have to pay out millions in compensation for ignoring the alarm. The six-strong gang dressed in high-vis jackets were captured on CCTV working throughout Thursday night having successfully broken into the basement of the building in the heart of London’s jewellery district. Shockingly, the footage reveals they returned again on Saturday - spending another eight hours cleaning out the jewels and cash left there for safekeeping. Scroll down for video . The Mirror has obtained the first pictures of the six-strong gang which raided Hatton Gardens last week . Images obtained by the Daily Mirror reveal the precise timings of the raid for the first time - as well as the fact they used wheelie bins to remove millions of pounds worth of jewellery and valuables from the safe. Scotland Yard tonight refused to confirm to MailOnline whether they had seen the footage before it was handed to them by the Mirror, but it is likely to place even more pressure on police already under fire for not responding to the alarm. The footage begins at 9.23pm – just four minutes after staff at the safety deposit centre lock up for the Easter weekend – as the first thief appears on camera carrying a black bin bag. It was unclear exactly where the cameras were situated, but at least one is aimed outside the building and shows a white van thought to be the getaway vehicle. Over the following four nights, half a dozen raiders are seen lugging heavy-duty tools, including massive bolt cutters and a red monkey wrench down to the secure vault. Each member of the gang is wearing builder’s overalls and high-visibility vests. At least one has a balaclava over his face, while others wear dust masks – but each one is partially reconisable. The first raider to appear has been dubbed Mr Ginger after the colour of his hair. Another, wearing a builder’s hat, has been referred to as Mr Strong and is seen carrying steel supports that may have been used for the diamond-tipped drill that police say cut through into the vault. The gang is thought to have hidden in an office before abseiling down a lift shaft and drilling into a vault . The Tall Man – who wears an Adidas tracksuit – carries two red tools up and down the stairs. Another, dubbed the Old Man because of his grey hair, later appears to struggle for breath in the footage as he lugs bags from the vault. Two other raiders have been nicknamed The Gent, for his smart brown shoes, and Mr Montana because he is wears a sweatshirt emblazoned with the word. Reports say that he has a shaved head, and possibly an earring in his left ear. At about 9.40pm the gang disappear into the building. At 7.52am on Good Friday, according to the footage, members of the gang can be seen again. The street camera captures the white Transit pull up to the alley. On Sunday, at around 6am, the gem thieves can be seen dragging heavy wheelie bins and several black bags back up the stairs. It has been reported these contained potentially millions of pounds worth of jewellery and valuables. The last trace of the raiders is recorded at 6.44am on Easter Sunday, when a white van pulls up and the gang load it with all the remaining equipment and disappear. Detective Chief Inspector Paul Johnson of the Flying Squad, speaks to journalists outside Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd today following last weekend's burglary in London . Another suspect, riding a moped, may also be connected to the gang. The raid was not discovered until the following Tuesday . The thieves apparently thought they had covered all their bases when covering their footsteps, but had failed to realise they had missed the cameras. A source told the Mirror: 'This was clearly the work of a professional gang who planned this job down to every last detail. 'But they may have made a mistake in leaving this footage behind.' The footage came to light as Scotland Yard was forced to admit it did not respond to a burglar alarm triggered during the raid - which could make it liable for million in compensation. That failure to investigate immediately left the gang free to work uninterrupted over Easter and escape with gems and cash worth ‘millions and millions’ from 70 deposit boxes - as can clearly be seen in the video. Officers were informed that the warning had been triggered shortly after midnight on Good Friday. But they decided that the possibility of a burglary did not need immediate investigation. Instead, a private security guard is understood to have made a cursory check of the building. Last night, jewellers who rent boxes with the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd security firm accused the police of incompetence and threatened to sue them and the owners of the deposit company. One jeweller, a 63-year-old named Michael, said: ‘As far as I’m concerned the police have got a lot to answer for. Suing anyone is a last resort but it’s something I would consider.’ A gang of criminals broke into the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd over the Easter Bank Holiday weekend . Another jeweller called Ryan, who runs a business with his father in Hatton Garden, added: ‘It is just unbelievable that they could ignore a call from an alarm company.’ The deposit firm has also faced criticism over the building’s ‘antiquated’ alarm system. Security expert Seamus Fahy, 47, said: ‘It was a well-planned heist, but the lack of modern technology made it a lot less difficult than it should have been.’ A Scotland Yard spokesman said: ‘A grade was applied to the call that meant that no police response was deemed to be required. We are now investigating why this grade was applied to the call. ‘It is too early to say if the handling of the call would have had an impact on the outcome of the incident.’","CCTV images reveal how the six-strong gang worked through the night .

64,"Former Saturday Night Live cast member Gary Kroeger announced Tuesday that he is running for Congress in Iowa . A former Saturday Night Live cast member is running for Congress in Iowa, and he says it isn't a laughing matter. Gary Kroeger said he will run in the 2016 Democratic primary for Iowa's 1st District. The 57-year-old Iowa native says he wants to focus on progressive policies, such as investing in education and protecting the environment. 'I'm a lion of liberalism. I truly embrace these policies of civil rights, economic equity, economic prosperity and upward mobility,' Kroeger said Tuesday. Kroeger appeared on Saturday Night Live from 1982 through 1985, and is perhaps best known for portraying Donny Osmond in a sketch with Julia Louis-Dreyfus. After a long entertainment career, he moved back to Iowa 12 years ago to raise his two sons. He now works for an advertising agency and lives in Waterloo. Freshman Republican Rep. Rod Blum currently represents the district, which covers the northeastern part of the state. Two other Democrats are already in the primary race: Cedar Rapids Councilwoman Monica Vernon and Cedar Rapids businessman Ravi Patel. Kroeger said he hasn't spoken about running for Congress with a fellow SNL alumnus, Minnesota Sen. Al Franken. Kroeger was a cast member on SNL from 1982 to 1985. Pictured on the left in a Christmas sketch with Julia Louis -Dreyfus (center) and Eddie Murphy as Gumby . Kroeger attended the the 40th anniversary of SNL in February, bringing his son Chris along for the celebrity-filled event . Kroeger said his run for office is no joke, but he hopes to enjoy the process. 'Nothing is funny about it, per se. It's very difficult,' Kroeger said. He later added: 'I am a person who is nearly 58 years old who has spent his life having a good time. Everything has to have an element of fun. There has to be a sense of joy.' He recently attended the 40th anniversary celebration of the sketch-comedy show, with son Chris as his guest.

65,"(CNN)A former U.S. Navy aircraft carrier that survived a Japanese torpedo strike and was a massive guinea pig for two atomic bomb blasts looks remarkably intact at the bottom of the Pacific, according to federal researchers who surveyed the wreck last month with an underwater drone. The USS Independence was scuttled in January 1951 during weapons testing near California's Farallon Islands. Although its location was confirmed by a survey in 2009, researchers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration went looking for it again in March as part of a project to map about 300 wrecks that lie in and around the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary. ""After 64 years on the seafloor, Independence sits on the bottom as if ready to launch its planes,"" mission leader James Delgado, the maritime heritage director for NOAA's Office of National Marine Sanctuaries, said in a statement. Indeed, sonar images show what looks to be an airplane on one of the elevators that took planes from the Independence's hangar deck to its flight deck. The ship sits upright with a slight list to starboard, according to NOAA. NOAA's survey of the 623-foot-long, 11,000-ton carrier was conducted by the Echo Ranger, an 18.5-foot-long autonomous underwater vehicle provided by the Boeing Co. The Echo Ranger traveled 30 miles from its base in Half Moon Bay, California, and hovered 150 above the carrier, which lies 2,600 feet below the surface of the Pacific Ocean. The drone used a three-dimensional sonar system provided by Coda Octopus to get images that showed how well the warship has weathered 64 years in the deep. ""This ship fought a long, hard war in the Pacific and after the war was subjected to two atomic blasts that ripped through the ship. It is a reminder of the industrial might and skill of the 'greatest generation' that sent not only this ship, but their loved ones to war,"" Delgado said in the statement. In its 20 years in the Navy, the ship played a role in some of the most important events of World War II, earning eight battle stars in the process, and the dawn of the nuclear age. Independence was seriously damaged by Japanese torpedo planes during the Battle of Tarawa in late 1943. The ship returned to California for repairs and made it back across the Pacific by July 1944 to participate in the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea and the sinking of one of the Japanese Imperial Navy's biggest warships, the battleship Musashi. Later, in the Battle of Cape Engano, planes from the Independence were involved in the sinking of four Japanese aircraft carriers. After the war, Independence became part of a fleet used to measure the effects of atomic bomb tests at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific on July 1, 1946. It sat just 560 yards from ground zero in the first test, a 23-kiloton air blast of a fission bomb similar to the one used over Nagasaki, Japan, a year earlier, according to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization. Twenty-four days later, Independence was 1,390 yards from the center of a second atomic blast -- also a 23-kiloton device but an underwater detonation. The ship was later brought back to California for nuclear decontamination before being sunk during the weapons training in 1951. NOAA said no signs of radioactive contamination were noted during the survey of the sunken carrier last month. The agency has no plans for further missions to the ship, according to the NOAA statement.","USS Independence was sunk in 1951 after weapons tests .

66,"Tikrit, Iraq (CNN)ISIS is gone, but the fear remains. As Iraqi forces, aided by Shiite militiamen, took control Wednesday of the northern city of Tikrit, they found vehicles laden with explosives and buildings that might be booby-trapped. CNN senior international correspondent Arwa Damon, who was in Tikrit on Tuesday, saw a large mechanical digger packed with explosives that Iraqi forces had to disarm. The troops, she said, were cautious when they entered buildings in case they were wired to explode. Plumes of smoke rose from burning buildings in the background. Near former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's presidential palaces compound -- Tikrit is Hussein's birthplace -- the CNN team also saw a destroyed truck with a large machine gun mounted on the back. Iraqi forces said they had fired an RPG at the truck, killing three ISIS fighters. ISIS was ejected from the palaces compound in fierce fighting, they said, adding that there may still be booby traps. Federal police said they dismantled hundreds of IEDs (improvised explosive devices) Wednesday. CNN heard at least 16 explosions, some very loud, which police said were controlled. The potential booby traps were political as well as physical. Officials are concerned about the behavior of the conquerors, particularly the Iranian-backed Shiite militiamen who helped Iraqi troops. Officials fear the militiamen might take ""scorched earth"" reprisals for the reported massacre of Shiite air force cadets by ISIS fighters in Tikrit last year. Much of the population of Tikrit is, like ISIS, Sunni Muslim. And officials fear that reprisals by Shiite militias against the Sunni population could stoke local anger, jeopardizing the government's ability to hold onto Tikrit and pull the country together. Sectarian resentment helped fuel the rise of ISIS in the first place. 'Where are our sons?' demand families of soldiers captured by ISIS . Still, the liberation of Tikrit from the terrorist group, which is also known as ISIL and calls itself the Islamic State, represented a significant victory for the Iraqi government, which had tried -- and failed -- to retake the city many times before. Iraqi  Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi arrived Wednesday to claim the victory, which took place a year after the city was first attacked by ISIS. Al-Abadi, who is also Iraq's top military commander, had announced the previous evening on Iraqiya TV that the city was under the control of Iraqi forces. Iraqi forces continued to clean out pockets of resistance Wednesday, said Interior Minister Mohammed al-Ghabban, who was also in the city. But he said the Iraqi government would be in full control shortly. ""The enemy has been defeated, and it has lost all its capabilities,"" al-Ghabban said. ""In the coming hours, the battle will end."" Iraqi security said that the few ISIS militants left in the city are hiding inside houses hoping to escape in the dark. ISIS' nine-month dominion over Tikrit was marked by brutality. In addition to the reported massacre of the 1,500-plus air force cadets at Camp Speicher in June, ISIS is believed to have buried victims in mass graves and to have destroyed an Assyrian church that had graced Tikrit since the eighth century. The push into Tikrit came days after U.S.-led airstrikes targeted ISIS bases around the city. Al-Abadi said those tactics would now be replicated in other areas. Brett McGurk, the U.S. deputy special presidential envoy to the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL, tweeted that the coalition's airstrikes had destroyed numerous ISIS shelters. ""We will continue to support courageous Iraqi forces operating under Iraqi command as they work to reclaim their territory from #ISIL,"" McGurk tweeted. The key to victory in Tikrit this time, the Prime Minister said, was surprise. But help from the coalition of Shiite militiamen and volunteers also played a part. The militia members, estimated to number around 20,000, are backed by Iran. The offensive marked the first open participation of Iranian advisers on the front lines in Iraq. The victory in Tikrit sets the stage for Iraqi forces to take back an even bigger prize -- Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city. A U.S. official said in February that up to 25,000 Iraqi troops plan to return to Mosul in April or May in an effort to retake the city. Don Melvin wrote this report in London. Arwa Damon and Hamdi Alkhshali reported from Tikrit and Jomana Karadsheh from Baghdad.","Tikrit is under the control of Iraqi forces, Iraqi Prime Minister says .

Officials hope to avoid Shia reprisals for ISIS slaughter of air force recruits .",38," After securing Tikrit, Iraqi forces found vehicles laden with explosives and buildings possibly rigged to explode.

67,"(CNN)It's only June, but 2015 may be remembered as the year the term ""transgender"" fully entered mainstream consciousness. In January, President Obama condemned the persecution of ""people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender,"" becoming the first president to utter the word in a State of the Union address. ""Transparent,"" about an aging father who begins living as a woman, won two top awards at the Golden Globes, while transgender actress Laverne Cox of ""Orange is the New Black"" -- who made the cover of Time magazine last year -- was just cast in a new CBS drama. The May issue of Vogue has a photo spread with transgender model Andreja Pejic, who said on Instagram this week that she ""was told by various people many times over that the chances of me ending up on these pages were slim to none."" A transgender character had a recurring storyline on the just-wrapped final season of ""Glee,"" while transgender activist and YouTube star Jazz Jennings will star in a reality show debuting on TLC this summer. And then there's Bruce Jenner, whose physical appearance has become more feminine in recent months as the Olympic hero turned reality TV star underwent a very public gender transition. Jenner ended months of speculation in an interview that aired April 24 on ""20/20"" with Diane Sawyer. ""Are you a woman?"" Sawyer asked. ""Yes,"" Jenner replied. Now comes the new issue of Vanity Fair, with Jenner on the cover in makeup and a skimpy dress, along with a new name: Caitlyn. It's more obvious than ever that transgender people, long relegated to society's shadows, are finally stepping into the light. ""We are at a social inflection point on transgender issues,"" says Riki Wilchins, a former transgender activist and author of three books on queer theory, who believes all the attention could have a positive impact. ""Civil rights for minorities come in fits and starts. We're on an upswing now."" Opinion: Why we need to listen to Bruce Jenner's story . Transgender is an umbrella term for people whose gender identity -- their internal, personal sense of being a man or a woman -- differs from what's typically associated with their sex at birth. Some transgender people alter their bodies through hormones and or surgery, although many don't. A 2011 study estimated that 700,000 American adults, or roughly 0.3% of the population, identified themselves as transgender. For decades, trans people, as many transgender people like to be called, rarely saw themselves represented in popular culture. But recent years have brought the ""Dancing with the Stars"" contestant Chaz Bono; filmmaker Lana Wachowski, formerly known as Larry Wachowski, a co-director of ""The Matrix""; Jared Leto's Oscar-winning role in ""Dallas Buyers Club""; and of course, ""Orange is the New Black,"" whose cast is a mix of ethnicities and sexualities. Now, between ""Transparent"" and other shows, recognition from Obama and tabloid headlines about Jenner, the national conversation around gender identity appears to have reached a new level. All this makes transgender advocates cautiously optimistic. Hayden Mora, deputy chief of staff at the Human Rights Campaign and a transgender man, remains hopeful that the growing number of transgender faces beaming weekly into America's living rooms can only have a positive effect. ""I believe that the more people who know transgender people, the more they will understand, accept and support us,"" Mora says. ""That happens only if they acknowledge our humanity, and not treat us like tabloid fodder."" The transgender life: What to know, say and understand . Still, activists agree there's a long way to go before transgender people stop facing discrimination or worse. For relatives and friends who are used to seeing someone as male or female, gender changes can be hard to accept. Transgender people have long been misunderstood and persecuted -- as recently as 2012, the American Psychiatric Association classified them as having a mental ""disorder."" A recent report by the Human Rights Campaign found that transgender people in the United States are more likely to face discrimination from employers and the effects of unemployment and poverty. Many also are denied services from safety-net providers such as emergency shelters. A poll last year found that 59% of Americans believe transgender students should use the bathroom of their birth gender. In December, Attorney General Eric Holder announced that transgender people will receive federal protection from discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. But violence against trans people -- especially transgender women of color -- remains a national plague. According to recent statistics from the Human Rights Campaign, at least 13 transgender women were slain last year in the United States and at least seven have already been killed this year. Of those 20 victims, all but one were black or Latina. ""We are definitely in a critical moment for the trans movement. Over the last year we have ... seen an increase in visibility that was unimaginable even just a few years ago,"" said Kris Hayashi, executive director of the Transgender Law Center. ""At the same time it is clear that visibility is not enough."" In one case that made national headlines, a transgender Ohio teen committed suicide in late December after her parents refused to acknowledge her wish to live as a girl. ""Transgender people are still subject to profound discrimination and violence,"" said Wilchins. ""Greater acceptance is really needed, and long overdue."" When your young daughter says 'I'm a boy' So what impact will Bruce Jenner's story have on all this? Gender-rights activists are reluctant to speculate. Some fear the media firestorm around Jenner, fueled by ties to the camera-loving Kardashian clan, trivializes what is a wrenching personal journey for many people. ""You want to wish Bruce the best. But at the same time, you wish it wasn't being played out for reality-TV entertainment,"" said Wilchins, the gender-rights advocate. ""Yes, it's great that we're educating people. But we're talking about a civil rights issue that keeps getting recast as entertainment."" As a much-hyped TV event, the Jenner interview gave millions of viewers their first exposure to gender-identity questions and put a sympathetic human face on an issue that remains perplexing to many people. But it could also trigger a backlash, some say. Amy Stone, associate professor of sociology and anthropology at Trinity University in San Antonio, Texas, fears Jenner could provoke those who already are averse to gay or transgender people. Such people ""tend to use these moments to frighten the general public, relying on fears about trans women in bathrooms or locker rooms,"" said Stone, author of numerous books about queer politics and culture. ""Usually these moments tap into pre-existing panics about gender or sexuality, not necessarily spawning new ones.""","Olympic hero Bruce Jenner appears on Vanity Fair cover as ""Caitlyn""

While this increased awareness could lead to greater acceptance, discrimination and violence against transgender people persist.

68,"A red hot Novak Djokovic is being tipped to end Rafa Nadal's stranglehold at Roland Garros in June but the Spaniard dismissed the threat as being no different to those he has faced before. The Serbian world number one has been an unstoppable force in recent weeks, winning 17 matches on the bounce and becoming the first man to win the season's first three Masters title. He comfortably beat Nadal on his beloved red clay in last week's Monte Carlo Masters semi-finals, and the nature of Djokovic's 6-3 6-3 mauling means plenty are backing him to complete his collection of grand slam titles this year by winning his first French Open. Rafa Nadal practices in Barcelona as he steps up his clay-court preparation ahead of the French Open . Nadal was beaten convincingly by Novak Djokovic in MOnet Carlo last week . But as far as Nadal is concerned, 2015 is no different to 2013, 2012 or even 2011. 'Djokovic was good in 2011, in 2012, 2013 as well as in 2015. Sometimes you win more and some you win less,' Nadal, who has triumphed at the French Open in nine of the last 10 years, told reporters at the Barcelona Open. 'It is difficult to win everything all the time. Djokovic was as good then in 2011 as he is now. He had an impeccable year in 2011 as well as he is having in 2015. I have to congratulate him. Djokovic is World No 1 and in superb form, but Nadal insists he has no worries about Roland Garros . The Spaniard is looking to win a sixth consecutive French Open, and a tenth in total . 'The rest of the players have to accept that at the moment he is the world number one with all he has achieved this year,' added Nadal, who has had a patchy year after making his comeback in January following another lengthy injury and illness break. 'This year I have to do things right, get back to a very high level to face him on the court,' Nadal said. 'Tennis-wise, I feel a lot better than a few weeks ago. I am going to try to get as far as I can and to play as well as I can, topping the level I showed in Monte Carlo.'

69,"A couple who chose to forsake their dream wedding in order to pay for one final shot at IVF are celebrating giving birth to twins and even found a way to say their 'I do's' Becca Litchfield, 29, and partner Dale, 30, from Gotham, Nottingham, were heart-broken when they discovered their savings would only be enough to cover the cost of a wedding, or fertility treatment. Desperate for a family, the couple chose to sacrifice their dream wedding and go ahead with IVF, but were over the moon when weeks later they became winners of a wedding competition. Becca and Dale Litchfield decided to give up their dream wedding in order to have one last shot at IVF and have since welcomed twins,  Darci-Mai (left) and  Stanley (right) The happy couple said their vows, and were overjoyed when they discovered the fertility treatment had worked - and Becca gave birth to twins Stanley and Darci-Mai. The full-time mother says that the couple can't believe their luck having achieved both of their dreams. 'When we realised we'd couldn't have children and get married, it was heart breaking,' she said. 'It was devastating to give up one of our dreams. We knew that we weren't getting any younger so the best option was to try IVF one last time, and sacrifice the wedding. 'It was a risk, because the IVF could have failed - and we'd have ended up with neither. 'But when we won the wedding competition, and then found out I was pregnant, it was unbelievable. Although they had given up on the idea of their perfect wedding the couple were blessed with yet another stroke of luck when they won a wedding contest which allowed them to finally get married . Before they conceived Darci-Mai (right) and Stanley (left) Becca and Dale had attempted two rounds of IVF . 'Now I've got my dream - the perfect husband and children, I couldn't be happier.' Becca and Dale, first started IVF treatment in 2012 after a year of failing to conceive naturally. The couple spent £5,500 on two rounds of IVF, keeping back an additional sum of money that they planned to spend on their wedding day. But after two failed attempts, Becca and Dale were forced to make a decision, Becca says that it was an incredibly difficult one to make. 'We were spending all of our money on IVF treatment hoping we'd conceive but after we failed twice I wondered if I'd ever get pregnant,' she said. 'We planned to use the spare money to get married but knew because of our ages we'd have to have kids now or never. 'I'd always dreamt of feeling my baby kick for the first time and the bond after giving birth, so I knew we had to try IVF one last time.' After winning the wedding competition the couple were able to have the white wedding they had always wanted . Becca, pictured with Darci-Mai (left) and Stanley (right) In order to conceive, Becca, pictured with Darci-Mai, had to take three hormone injections a day but she says it was entirely worth it . After abandoning hopes of a big celebration the couple decided to at least secure their relationship with a proposal. 'We were advised to wait for a year before trying again - I was just counting down the days,' she said. 'It felt like time was ticking away so quickly. At the end of the year, Dale and I officially became engaged - it was a way to lift our spirits and we thought if we couldn't have a big wedding, we could at least get engaged.' But unbeknownst to Becca, during their year long wait for IVF, Dale, who works as an electrician, entered the pair into a win a wedding competition. Becca says that once again fate was in their favour having initially been runners-up. Becca says that she and Dale couldn't stop beaming when they discovered they were expecting twins . 'We actually came second in the competition, but then the first place dropped out and so we won,' she said. 'We couldn't believe it - after all the heart ache and the decision making, we were getting both. 'It felt like a miracle. I'd always dreamt of a big white wedding and walking down the aisle, but I'd put that to the back of my mind. 'I couldn't believe my dreams were going to become a reality.' After the wedding, the pair changed fertility clinics and had their final round of IVF. It was here that medics discovered Becca had low hormone levels and started to treat her for the problem, giving her three hormone injections a day to increase the chance of her falling pregnant . When Becca first discovered she was pregnant she was so shocked she took four tests to make sure. She gave birth to twins Darci-Mai (left) and Stanley (right) Becca says that it was a challenging period but she was prepared to carry on in hope of having her dream family. 'I felt like a pin cushion while I was having all the treatment but knew it was worth it. 'Then after the eggs were implanted I took two weeks off work to relax and do nothing other than sit with my legs up in the hope it would help us to get pregnant. 'Then we did a pregnancy test and it was positive. We didn't want to get our hopes up but after four more tests said we were pregnant I believed it.' Overjoyed with the news Becca was then astounded to find out that she was not carrying just one baby but two. 'Once I knew I was pregnant I had a feeling we were going to have twins and when doctors confirmed it we couldn't believe it. 'When the doctor told me there were two heartbeats we were all gobsmacked. The twins were born on 27th September last year . Becca says that even when the Darci-Mai (left) and Stanley (right) are screaming she feels lucky to have them . 'Me and Dale sat beaming at each other, we couldn't believe we were about to have one baby let alone twins.' The twins were born in September last year and six months later the couple still can't quite believe their luck. Becca said: 'It's amazing to think how dramatically our life changed in one year - we got married and now have a beautiful boy and girl. 'Even now I still feel so privileged to have children - even when they are screaming I keep thinking thank goodness that they are with us. 'Before I thought of myself as very unlucky, I'd never won anything in my life. 'But since winning our wedding and having kids it still doesn't feel real. 'I've definitely used my life's worth of luck now but I don't care because I've got everything I ever dreamed of so I'm happy. 'Finally everything's gone right, we are finally married parents after everything we've been through it is incredible.'","Becca and Dale Litchfield spent their wedding savings on IVF .

70,"Police were making their final security checks outside St. Mary's Hospital in Paddington today, as the birth of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's second child approaches. With Kate's due date is just over three days away, officers were out in force, pulling lamp posts apart as they scoured the area for anything troubling. The police were watched by a small but growing group of royal fans, many of whom had set up camp on a set of benches and had decorated the area with posters and bunting. Scroll down for video .

Mr Loughery, a former chef, said at the time he hoped to go down in history for the feat and told the BBC that he wouldn't be surprised 'if a portrait of me is hanging inside Kensington Palace in 100 years from now'. Today, he was more concerned about the Queen and her 89th birthday and happily showed off a handmade sign wishing her many happy returns. Along with group of fellow fans, Mr Loughery went on to delight the world's media - many of whom have gathered but have so far had little to do - with a chorus of Happy Birthday.

Equally serious about the Royal Family is Margaret Tyler, 71, an avid collector of royal memorabilia who has amassed a trove worth more than £10,000. Mrs Tyler, who gave birth to her son Andrew at the Lindo Wing, says she considers the royals to be part of her family and has been following their exploits for more than 40 years. Her collection of royal souvenirs, which includes a £1,200 bust of Prince Charles, is so vast, it takes up four rooms in her small terraced home in London.

71,"A man who claims he kicked a young mother out of his car when she got too drunk on their date has been arrested for obstructing justice two weeks after she vanished. Ashley Pegram, a 28-year-old mother-of-three, left her Summerville, South Carolina home for a date with a man she had met on messaging service Kik on the evening of April 3. Her sister, Brandy Chance, reported her missing the next day and went through her Kik account, where she found messages from a man who identified himself as 18-year-old Emoney Bon.

Bonilla has been charged with obstruction of justice and he was given a $400,000 surety bond during a court appearance on Thursday. Pegram's sister, Brandy Chance, said the missing woman's children, aged 13, eight and nine months, are devastated. 'Her little baby's having nightmares,' she told ABC News 4.

72,"Washington (CNN)One former employee of the private Blackwater Worldwide security company was sentenced Monday to life in prison and three others to 30 years each behind bars for their roles in a 2007 mass shooting in Baghdad that left 17 people dead. A federal jury convicted the four in October after a lengthy trial that saw some 30 witnesses travel from Iraq to testify against the security contractors. Prosecutors accused the men of illegally unleashed ""powerful sniper fire, machine guns and grenade launchers on innocent men, women and children."" Senior U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth sentenced Blackwater sniper Nicholas Slatten to a term of life in prison, mandatory for his first-degree murder conviction. Blackwater workers Paul Slough, Evan Liberty and Dustin Heard were sentenced to 30 year each, plus one day. Slough was convicted of 13 counts of voluntary manslaughter, 17 counts of attempted manslaughter and a firearms offense. The jury convicted Liberty of eight counts of voluntary manslaughter, 12 counts of attempted manslaughter and a firearms offense. Heard was found guilty of six counts of voluntary manslaughter, 11 counts of attempted manslaughter and a firearms offense. According to prosecutors, the four were among seven Blackwater employees who opened fire in the Nusoor Square traffic circle in Baghdad, killing 17 people. An FBI investigation found 14 of the deaths unjustified, according to rules of engagement for private security contractors in Iraq. Slatten was accused of firing the first shots. Survivors of shooting tell FBI their stories in 2007 . Blackwater said its convoy came under attack, and defense attorneys said in court that witness accounts were fabricated. But witnesses testified that the contractors opened fire without provocation. ""It was horror,"" said Hasan Jaber, an attorney who was driving to work when he was shot three times. ""People running out of their cars were being shot at. ... Anything that moved in Nusoor Square was shot. Women, children, young people, they shot everyone."" Among the dead were two boys, 9 and 11, a doctor, a used car salesman, a truck driver, a businessman, an Iraqi soldier, a gardener, a taxi driver and an aspiring doctor taking his mother to an appointment, according to prosecutors. The parents and brothers of the 9-year-old victim were present in court during the sentencing hearing and spoke. Ali Razzaq's father looked at the defendants and yelled in broken English: ""If I kill anyone in his family, what he do?! Today, we will see who will win, the law or Blackwater,"" he said. ""Blackwater killed my son."" Dad in 2007: Blackwater blew up son's and wife's 'skulls' The defense presented character witnesses, family members and former colleagues who testified to the defendants' capacity to work under fire and willingness to help others. Each defendant also gave a closing statement. Slatten addressed the court last, taking the opportunity to declare his innocence. Lamberth rejected his argument. The judge said that the punishments reflected the seriousness of the crimes. He said that the U.S. government ""should be commended for finding and exposing the truth of what happened."" Blackwater incident witness in 2007: 'It was hell' A few gasps were heard in the courtroom, and some crying. The case was initially dismissed in 2008 after a judge found the Justice Department withheld key evidence and violated the rights of the contractors. A federal appeals court reversed the ruling, paving the way for the two-month trial that ended in convictions for the four. Another contractor, Jeremy Ridgeway, pleaded guilty in 2008 to voluntary manslaughter and attempt to commit manslaughter and testified for the government. He has not yet been sentenced. Blackwater lost its $1 billion contract with the State Department to protect American diplomatic personnel in 2009, after the Iraqi government refused to renew the company's operating license. The company was later renamed and sold, and now operates as ACADEMI, providing protection services and training. 2007 congressional report: Blackwater most often shoots first .

73,"The cyclone strength winds currently battering the NSW coast are being caused by an intense low-pressure system known as an East Coast Low. The stormy weather system,  formed in the Tasman Sea, hasn't hit NSW this strong since 2007 and is expected to be one of the longest lasting ever. East Coast Lows are particularly common in June and tend to be more frequent in autumn and winter. They are characterised by gales or storm force winds that can damage buildings, fell trees and powerlines, cause powerful surf that can damage the coast and, in some cases, run ships aground. They can also dump hundreds of millimetres of rain, causing flash flooding and riverine flooding. Climate specialist Don White from WeatherWatch told Daily Mail Australia: 'It forms occasionally, usually once a year. But this particular one is quite strong and close to the coast winds are up to 135kmh and rain up to 200mm.’ ‘This one is probably the strongest since 2007 and it is also going to be the longest lasting one,’ Mr White said. Scroll down for video . A large gum tree (left) that has been uprooted on a property at Booragul, a suburb near Lake Macquarie north of Sydney in NSW. Powerful winds on Monday night and Tuesday morning also brought down scaffolding (right) in Edgecliff, in Sydney's eastern suburbs . ‘They normally move away after 12 hours but this one is going to stick around for 24- 36 hours, which is unusually long for an East Coast Low.’ East Coast Lows draw strong, moisture-laden winds across the coast, which cause heavy rain to fall when they are uplifted by the hills and ranges that run parallel to the coast. On Monday night 24 Sydney suburbs incurred 100mm of rainfall, with Blacktown hit hardest, thanks to the latest East Coast Low. An estimated 100,000 homes are without power on Tuesday morning across Sydney, the Central Coast and Hunter region. And a floodwater rescue operation is underway in Hunter area where there have been wind gusts of up to 125km/h - levels recorded in category two cyclones.

State Emergency Services Deputy Commissioner Steve Pearce told the ABC on Tuesday the police and NSW Fire and Rescue had been called in to help the SES on the 2400 call-outs they've received so far, with many more expected in daylight when people can see the damage around their homes. 'We've had 24 hours of relentless gale-force winds. I haven't seen this wind damage for years,' Mr Pearce said. Some have speculated this week’s East Coast Low will be the worst in five years, while meteorologist with Weatherzone Rob Sharpe told the Sydney Morning Herald: ‘This is going to be our most significant east coast low since spring.’ ‘The last major one that has affected Newcastle was in 2007. East Coast Lows were common in the 1970s but became less common in the 90s,’ Mr White said. Winds of at least 100km/h lashed parts of the east coast, causing this tree to fall on a car in East Gosford, on the NSW Central Coast, on Monday with a driver and passenger inside.

Other notable east coast lows occurred in October 2004, when there were mean wave heights off Sydney of 5m with a maximum height of about 10m. In August 1998, more than 300mm of rain fell over four days in Sydney and Illawarra, 420mm at Beaumont and 401mm at Kangaroo Valley.

The area's forecast says to expect possible snow showers in areas above 1200m and temperatures between -2 and 3 degrees .","The weather system is called an East coast low. It is formed from low-pressure over the Tasman Sea .

It has strong winds causing damage to buildings, trees, powerlines, and flash flooding. This particular low is expected to last for 24-36 hours, making it unusually long compared to past occurrences. The system draws moisture-laden winds across the coast, resulting in heavy rainfall when uplifted by hills and ranges parallel to the coast. Power outages affect Sydney, Blacktown, and other parts of New South Wales as a result of this low.","A powerful East Coast Low, forming in the Tasman Sea, is battering the NSW coast with intense winds and heavy rainfall. This storm, one of the strongest since 2007, has caused widespread damage, including uprooted trees, downed power lines, and flooding.

The State Emergency Services (SES) has received over 2400 calls for assistance, with many more expected as the storm lingers for an unusually long period.  Power outages affect over 100,000 homes across Sydney, the Central Coast, and Hunter region. 

While this East Coast Low is reminiscent of severe storms in 2007 and past decades, meteorologists warn that its intensity and duration pose a significant threat to coastal communities. The storm's impact has extended beyond NSW, with snowfall reported at Perisher and Thredbo ski fields.

74,"Everyone knows the tortoise  beat the hare, but this little fellow has gone one better and beaten two cheetahs. These pictures capture the amazing moment when one of the notoriously slow-moving reptiles escaped becoming big cat fast food  by retreating into its shell before scuttling off across desert sands. The baffled cheetahs surrounded the tortoise and attempted to scare it out of its shell with snarls but the reptile kept well tucked up inside its tough exterior forcing the big cats to wander off in search of another snack. Hard target: The tortoise attempts a quick getaway under the watchful eye of one of the curious cheetahs . Confused: The two cheetahs exchange glances as they move in to size up their potential meal . The intriguing scene was captured by John Mullineux, a chemical engineer from Secunda, South Africa. He said: 'While driving on the sandy tracks of the Kalahari Desert in South Africa, I came across two cheetahs lying in the shade near the road. 'Shortly after I stopped, they got up and slowly headed to the dunes. 'Halfway up the red sandy dune the younger one stopped to inspect a tortoise, the older one also stopped and tried to bite the shell but couldn't manage it. Now you see me: The tortoise retreats into its shell as the big cats get too close for comfort . Snarl: One of the cheetahs gets up close and personal to the little reptile and tries to scare it out of its shell . 'By the time the older cheetah had made it to the top of the dune, the younger one decided to run off and follow rather than spend more time at the hard meal. 'The tortoise then casually moved on as if nothing unusual had happened. From a young age I have loved cheetahs for their elegance and speed - seeing two so close was dream but seeing them size up their lunch was unique. 'It was something that was both exciting and naturally beautiful at the same time.' Slow and steady: The tortoise continues his escape across the sands of the Kalahari desert in South Africa .

75,"The family of a teenager who should have died after overdosing on a mix of heroin and Xanax has shared images of him in hospital in a bid to deter others from taking drugs. Brayden Travis, 18, was left without medical attention for seven hours after taking drugs at a friend's house in St Charles County, Missouri in early March. His lungs and kidneys failed, and he suffered a stroke and severe brain damage. Doctors warned that he will likely remain in a vegetative state, his mother, Kelly Smith-Miller, wrote on Facebook. She also shared a starling photograph of the teenager unconscious in a hospital bed with breathing apparatus and wires across his body. Overdose: Brayden Travis, 18, suffered a stroke and severe brain damage after overdosing on heroin and Xanax last month. His mother shared this photo of him to Facebook to deter others from taking drugs . 'If my son's story and picture can save one life or contribute to the education and awareness of drug abuse, then he and I are very happy!' she wrote in her post. 'He wouldn't want this for anyone else and he would tell anyone not to use drugs … ever! I can tell you he tried to fight this addiction and I pray this time it hasn't won!' The post has been shared more than 337,000 times. Brayden is now breathing on his own and wakes up and opens and closes his eyes, although his reactions are inconsistent, the St Louis Post-Dispatch reported. 'Medical personnel believe my son should have been dead long before he was able to get the medical attention he needed, but for some unknown reason he has stabilized,' she wrote. Addiction: His mother explained that Brayden, left before the overdose, has struggled with drug addiction since he was 15. He is now conscious in hospital, seen right, and is breathing on his own . 'He is making progress, but we have a long road to travel. Even though the outcome is not expected to be positive, as a mother I will not give up until I have exhausted all options and know that I've done everything I can.' Brayden had long been battling with addiction, she said. He first started smoking marijuana when he was 15 and eventually moved on to heroin. He enrolled in five or six treatment programs and left three of them, she told the Post-Dispatch. He spent eight months in juvenile custody for using drugs and failing drug tests, she added. As he struggled with addiction, he moved between his grandmother's home and his mother's home, and at the time of his overdose, he was living with his father in St Charles County. By his side: Mother Kelly Smith-Miller, pictured with her son left, and his father, Todd Travis, right, said they hope he will pull though so he can 'come home and have a life that will be worth living' 'He was living with me doing well, then I go in his room every morning to check on him and he is gone,' his dad, Todd Travis, wrote on his own Facebook page. 'He is my only child, my mini me, and my life! Please everyone pray for Brayden to someday have his body and and his brain healed so he can come home and have a life that will be worth living.' Speaking to the Post-Dispatch, Travis, who tried to set a good example for his son by working out and eating well, added: 'You go over what you could have done better.' But he is still hopeful that his son will recover, and shared his joy on Facebook that his son has been laughing in hospital. 'I'm looking into his eyes, man - and he's looking at me,' he said.","Brayden Travis, from St Charles County, Missouri, has battled drug addiction since he was 15 and overdosed on heroin in early March .

79,"A Manchester canal was turned into a giant bubble bath after fire crews tackling a nearby chemical plant blaze saw their water mix with a detergent creating a six foot wall of foam. The Ashton Canal was filled with heavy suds which appeared after a fire at an industrial unit occupied by a drug development company. It is believed that the water used by firefighters to dampen down the flames mixed with the detergent being stored in the burning buildings. Scroll down for video . The Ashton Canal in Manchester, which was turned into a giant bubble bath when fire crews tackled a blaze at a nearby chemical plant . It is believed that the water used by firefighters to dampen down the flames mixed with the detergent being stored in the burning buildings . Three-year-old Jason Kernick looks out of the window of his family's canal boat as they try to navigate their way through the foam . This then turned into a huge wall of foam when it drained into the canal, which runs in the shadow of Manchester City's Etihad Stadium. Now the Environment Agency have launched an investigation to assess if the foam has impacted on wildlife after concerns were raised for the safety of fish in the affected waters. A spokesman for the agency said: 'The Environment Agency is investigating after receiving reports of foam on a 30 metre stretch of the Ashton Canal, Manchester.

80,"Real Madrid's Champions League victory over city rivals Atletico on Wednesday night marked the eighth match Gareth Bale has not started this season... and Real have won every single one. The Welshman has received some criticism from sections of the Bernabeu support despite a bright start in Madrid, and these remarkable stats will do nothing to help his popularity at the club. The £86million man has missed out on just eight starts in Real Madrid's 50 matches this term, but his team-mates have picked up a 100 per cent win record when he has been away, scoring 25 and conceding just one goal. Gareth Bale has not started eight of Real Madrid's matches this season, through injury and omission . His latest injury, suffered against Malaga, meant he missed Wednesday night's Champions League game . Bale's time on the sidelines has coincided with huge matches against Barcelona, two Champions League ties with Liverpool (in which he entered the fray as a 62nd-minute substitute at the Bernabeu), and Wednesday night's European quarter-final against Atletico... but it seems the rest of the Real squad are just fine without him. In the first half of the season, Bale suffered a buttock muscle injury while on international duty with Wales, and he missed La Liga matches against Levante (5-0 win), Barcelona (3-1 win), Granada (4-0 win) and a 3-0 Champions League victory against Liverpool. He was in contention for the return leg against Liverpool at the Bernabeu, but did not start the match, instead coming on as a second-half substitute. Real were 1-0 up when he came on, and the score remained the same until the final whistle. In December, Madrid were already leading 4-1 against third-tier side Cornella in their Copa del Rey tie heading into the second leg, and Carlo Ancelotti opted to rest some of his biggest names. Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema, Toni Kroos, Sergio Ramos and Bale were all among the stars watching on from the sidelines as Los Blancos recorded a comfortable 5-0 win. That's six games without Bale in the starting line-up, and six wins for Real. Moving into 2015, Bale played a major role in the team's start to the year, scoring 12 goals between his return to the side against Celta Vigo and his omission against Eibar on April 11. Bale was sidelined for Real's 3-1 win over Barcelona, in which Cristiano Ronaldo scored a penalty . Karim Benzema scored in a 3-0 win against Liverpool at Anfield in October... Bale was injured for the game . Ancelotti stated in the build-up to the match that he had decided to rest the Welshman, while the team went on to win 3-0 against their struggling opposition. Bale again returned the side for two matches, a goalless draw against Atletico Madrid in the Champions League and a win against Malaga in La Liga, but suffered a calf injury in the early stages of the latter domestic clash. Instead of taking to the field in the crucial European match on Wednesday night, Bale was resigned to watching the match from home, where he tweeted his support of the team. Javier Hernandez's goal against Atletico ensured Real have won all of their eight matches without Bale . The Welshman took to Facebook on Wednesday to wish Real Madrid good luck against city rivals Atletico . Javier Hernandez's late goal ensured another victory for Ancelotti's men, taking their Bale-less record to eight wins, no draws and no losses. With the Welshman, Real have a 69 per cent win record, far from disastrous, recording 29 wins, four draws and nine losses. But the stats without him will surely give ammunition to those unhappy with their £86million man.","Gareth Bale has not started eight of Real Madrid's matches this season .

81,"A new diet could more than halve a person's risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, according to new research. Experts said the diet, known by the acronym MIND, could reduce the risk of the illness even if it not meticulously followed. The 'Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay' (MIND) diet includes at least three daily servings of wholegrains and salad  – along with an extra vegetable and a glass of wine. The new diet could more than halve a person's risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, new research has found, and even has an effect when a person doesn't follow it meticulously . These 'brain-healthy foods' lowered the risk of Alzheimer's by 53 per cent in those who stuck to the diet rigidly. For those that followed it moderately well, it lowered the risk by about 35 per cent. Professor Martha Morris, a nutritional epidemiologist of the Rush University Medical Centre in Chicago,  said: 'One of the more exciting things about this is that people who adhered even moderately to the MIND diet had a reduction in their risk for Alzheimer's disease. 'I think that will motivate people.' Professor Morris and her colleagues developed the MIND diet based on years of past research about what foods and nutrients have good and bad effects on the functioning of the brain. This is the first study to relate the MIND diet to Alzheimer's disease. 'I was so very pleased to see the outcome we got from the new diet,' she said. The MIND diet is a hybrid of the Mediterranean and DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diets, both of which have been found to reduce the risk of cardiovascular conditions, like high blood pressure, heart attack and stroke. Wine is a 'healthy brain food', researchers said . 10 HEALTHY BRAIN FOODS: . Green leafy vegetables . Other vegetables . Nuts . Berries . Beans . Wholegrains . Fish . Poultry . Olive oil . Wine . 5 UNHEALTHY BRAIN FOODS: . Red meats . Butter and margarine . Cheese . Pastries and sweets . Fried or fast food . Some researchers have found that the two older diets provide protection against dementia as well. In the latest study, the MIND diet was compared with the two other diets. People with high adherence to the DASH and Mediterranean diets also had reductions in Alzheimer's disease— 39 per cent with the DASH diet and 54 per cent with the Mediterranean diet. However, the diets had negligible benefits when people only adhered to it moderately. Professor Morris added that the MIND diet is also easier to follow than the Mediterranean diet, which calls for daily consumption of fish and three to four daily servings of fruits and vegetables. The MIND diet has 15 components, including 10 'brain-healthy food groups' — green leafy vegetables, other vegetables, nuts, berries, beans, whole grains, fish, poultry, olive oil and wine. It also has five unhealthy groups that comprise red meats, butter and stick margarine, cheese, pastries and sweets, and fried or fast food. The MIND diet includes at least three servings of wholegrains, a salad and one other vegetable every day — along with a glass of wine. It also involves snacking most days on nuts and eating beans every other day or so, poultry and berries at least twice a week and fish at least once a week. Dieters must limit eating the designated unhealthy foods, eating less than one tablespoon of butter a day and eating cheese, fried or fast food to less than once a week. Limiting these foods is essential to have a real shot at avoiding the devastating effects of Alzheimer's, according to the study. Berries are the only fruit specifically to make the MIND diet. Professor Morris said: 'Blueberries are one of the more potent foods in terms of protecting the brain,' adding that strawberries have also performed well in past studies of the effect of food on cognitive function. The diet suggests 10 brain-healthy foods including wholegrains, salad, vegetables, berries, nuts, beans, olive oil, poultry and fish . The MIND diet was not an intervention in this study, however; researchers looked at what people were already eating. Participants earned points if they ate brain-healthy foods frequently and avoided unhealthy foods. The one exception was that participants got one point if they said olive oil was the primary oil used in their homes. The study enlisted volunteers already participating in the ongoing Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP), which began in 1997 among residents of Chicago-area retirement communities and senior public housing complexes. An optional 'food frequency questionnaire' was added from 2004 to February 2013, and the MIND diet study looked at results for 923 volunteers. The diet advises limiting butter to one tablespoon a day and limiting cheese, pastries, sweets and fast or friend food to once a week . A total of 144 cases of Alzheimer's disease developed in this group of people. The disease, which takes a devastating toll on cognitive function, is not unlike heart disease in that there appear to be 'many factors that play into who gets the disease,' including behavioral, environmental and genetic components, Professor Morris said. She continued: 'With late-onset Alzheimer's disease, with that older group of people, genetic risk factors are a small piece of the picture.' Past studies have yielded evidence that suggests what we eat may play a significant role in determining who gets the illness and who doesn't, Professor Morris added. When the researchers in the new study left out of analysis of participants who changed their diets somewhere along the line — say, on a doctor's orders after a stroke — they found there was a stronger link between the MIND diet and more favourable outcomes in terms of Alzheimer's disease. The diet's developer said blueberries are 'one of the more potent foods in terms of protecting the brain' He said: 'That probably means that people who eat this diet consistently over the years get the best protection.' In other words, it looks like the longer a person eats the MIND diet, the less risk that person will have of developing Alzheimer's, Professor Morris said. As is the case with many health-related habits, including physical exercise, she said, 'You'll be healthier if you've been doing the right thing for a long time.' She added that the study did not establish a cause and effect relationship between the MIND diet and a lowered risk of Alzheimer's. Other studies on different populations would need to be carried out to do this, she said. The study was funded by the National Institute on Aging.","Called the 'Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay'

83,"Michael Bloomberg wants to be mayor again - but in London rather than New York City, according to reports. Bloomberg, who was elected to the top Big Apple job three times in a row, has reportedly turned his sights across the Atlantic, where he dreams of replacing incumbent Boris Johnson. According to Britain's Sunday Times, Bloomberg, 73, is 'considering' the move, and has the backing of senior officials in Britain's Conservative Party. Scroll down for video . Passing the torch? Michael Bloomberg, right, is pictured above with London mayor Boris Johnson. He is reportedly considering standing for Johnson's job in 2016 . Bloomberg has significant business interests in the city. His Bloomberg financial information company has offices there, while he personally owns a $30million mansion. In the past he has described London as his 'second home'. His ex-wife is a British citizen, as are his two daughters. Though Bloomberg holds U.S. citizenship, sources told the Sunday Times that officials could arrange for a switch to make him eligible for high office. London is due a new mayor in 2016. Boris Johnson, who was himself born in New York City, will then have held the position for eight years. 'Job swap': Johnson, right, who is seen as a future Prime Minister, once joked about swapping jobs with Bloomberg, left, who has said he thinks of London as a 'second home' If Michael Bloomberg does become Mayor of London, it would be the latest twist in a long career which has seen him rise to the top in both business and politics. He started his career as an investment banker with Salomon Brothers, and when he was laid off from the firm in 1981 he used his $10million payout to start his own financial information company, Bloomberg LP. The firm is best known for the 'Bloomberg terminals' which provide real-time updates on the financial markets and are now ubiquitous on banks' trading floors. Bloomberg has also spawned an network of news outlets including a cable TV station, financial news website and the magazine Businessweek. In 2001, Mr Bloomberg entered politics by running as the Republican candidate for mayor of New York City, and spent $73million of his own money getting elected. He went on to serve 12 years as mayor, drawing praise for his businesslike management of city government, but he courted controversy with high-profile decisions such as banning smoking indoors and outlawing extra-large sodas. Despite his repeated electoral success, Mr Bloomberg has faced opposition from the Left over his close links to Wall Street, while the Right has reacted with anger against his campaign to impose new restrictions on gun ownership across the US. Johnson is also standing for a seat in Britain's parliament in the country's May elections. He has said if he wins he will stay in the mayor's job until 2016, while serving as MP for the London constituency of Uxbridge and South Ruislip at the same time. He has long been spoken of as a future Prime Minister, and was recently named by incumbent David Cameron as a potential successor. Johnson has spoken before of the advantages of a new mayor coming in, though he could technically run for a third term. Speaking in 2013 to London radio station LBC, he said: 'The reality is that after eight years you've been at it for a long time in a very big job. 'You see what happens to people who do things for too long. You've got to be fair to the electorate, you've got to be sure you are doing your best. 'There will come people who will have fantastic ideas and who will have fresh ways of thinking about things.' Bloomberg and Johnson have met before - and at one meeting in 2013, Johnson even joked about doing a 'job swap' with Bloomberg - though there is no suggestion Johnson has set his sights on New York City. A source close to Johnson told the Sunday Times: 'Mike is an enormous friend of London. He’s a great contributor to the city. He’s got many supporters and admirers of which Boris is definitely one.' If indeed Bloomberg decided on an unlkely run for mayor, he would have to jump through some hoops. As an American citizen he would have to apply for British residency. This process is lengthy but can be speeded up if the person invested $15 million into the country. This would present no difficulties for Bloomberg who is the 13th richest man in the world, worth $36 billion.

84,"Playing video games makes you better at learning than non-gamers, a study has claimed. Research found that gaming boosts the ability to learn a number of tasks more accurately, and possibly puts gamers in an 'expert category' of problem solving. But the researchers note they are not quite sure if gaming makes people learn skills better - or if people who learn skills better are more likely to become gamers. Playing video games (stock image shown) may not only improve the ability to perform visual tasks, but also the learning ability for those skills, a study by Brown University in Rhode Island has claimed . The research was carried out by scientists at Brown University in Rhode Island. To conduct the study, the researchers pitted nine frequent gamers against a control group of nine people who game rarely, if ever. They participated in a two-day trial of visual task learning. Subjects were shown an on-screen ‘texture’ of either visual or horizontal lines and had to quickly point out - in a fraction of a second - the one area where an anomalous texture appeared. Parents are in danger of being reported to police by their children's head teachers if they allow them to play video games for over 18s. A letter sent by a group of schools in Cheshire raised concerns about the 'levels of violence and sexual content' young people are being exposed to by playing games such as Call of Duty and Grand Theft Auto, which are renowned for their violent characters and have an 18 classification. It warns that if teachers are made aware their pupils have been playing these video games they will contact police and social services. The letter, sent by Nantwich Education Partnership, said allowing children to play these type of games on Xboxes and Playstations is deemed 'neglectful'. In visual processing research this is a standard protocol called a ‘texture discrimination task.’ Prior studies have shown that people can be trained to improve their performance in the task, but if they move on to a second task too quickly, it can interfere with the learning process. The researchers wanted to find out if gamers could overcome this interference better, compared to non-gamers. And the results showed that gamers managed to improve performance on both tasks, while non-gamers did what was expected. That is, they improved on the second task they trained on, but not on the first. Learning the second task interfered with learning the first. The data show that gamers on average improved their combination of speed and accuracy by about 15 per cent on their second task and about 11 per cent on their first task. Non-gamers produced the same average 15 per cent improvement on their second task, but they actually got a bit worse on the first task they learned, by about 5 per cent. Research subjects were shown an on-screen texture of short lines - either vertical or horizontal, first one then the other - and were asked to spot anomalies. Their responses were measured in milliseconds. Gamers were shown to be more successful when learning both tasks than non-gamers . Despite the small number of participants, the results proved statistically significant. ‘When we study perceptual learning we usually exclude people who have tons of video game playing time because they seem to have different visual processing. They are quicker and more accurate,' said senior author Dr Yuka Sasaki, associate professor of cognitive, linguistic and psychological sciences at Brown University. ‘But they may be in an expert category of visual processing. ‘We sometimes see that an expert athlete can learn movements very quickly and accurately and a musician can play the piano at the very first sight of the notes very elegantly, so maybe the learning process is also different. ‘Maybe they can learn more efficiently and quickly as a result of training.’ The exact neural mechanisms underlying visual or perceptual learning are not yet known, Dr Sasaki said, but the study suggests that gamers may have a more efficient process for hardwiring their visual task learning than non-gamers. ‘It may be possible that the vast amount of visual training frequent gamers receive over the years could help contribute to honing consolidation mechanisms in the brain, especially for visually developed skills,’ the researchers wrote. After training on both backgrounds, testing showed that video gamers had done better at learning the first and second. Non-gamers actually did worse on the first. But it was unresolved whether video games improve visual learning or whether good visual learners tend to play more video games . Being certain will require more research. Importantly, the study doesn't prove whether playing video games improves learning ability or whether people with an innate ability become gamers because they find gaming more rewarding. The study also has a stark gender imbalance between the nearly all-male gamer group and the nearly all-female non-gamer group. But the researchers could not find evidence in the literature for gender differences in perceptual learning that would make this disparity worrisome. By documenting these and other apparent cognitive differences between gamers and non-gamers, the field is discovering that there is more to video games than merely passing the time, lead author and graduate student Aaron Berard said. ‘A lot of people still view video games as a time-wasting activity even though research is beginning to show their beneficial aspects,’ Mr Berard said. ‘If we can demonstrate that video games may actually improve some cognitive functioning, perhaps we, as a society, can embrace newer technology and media with positive application.’","Researchers at Brown University studied how people learned tasks .

Gamers improved performance on both tasks, while non-gamers struggled with the first task after learning the second. Gamers exhibited a 15% average improvement in speed and accuracy for both tasks, compared to non-gamers who only improved on the second task. The study, however, doesn't definitively conclude if gaming causes better learning or if individuals predisposed to learning choose gaming. Further research is needed to address this ambiguity. 


","Brown University study finds frequent video gamers learn tasks more accurately than non-gamers, possibly putting them in an 'expert category' for problem-solving. Gamers showed 15% improvement on a second task and 11% on the first, unlike non-gamers who worsened by 5% on the initial task.","A Brown University study found that frequent video gamers outperformed non-gamers in learning two visual tasks, suggesting potential for enhanced visual processing and learning efficiency in gamers.

87,"A newly released video shows the shocking moment a Boston police officer was shot in the face just seconds after approaching a driver who was stopped during a gunfire investigation. The video shows how Angelo West, 41, immediately jumps out of the car and shoots Officer John Moynihan, 34, under the eye at close range after the policeman opens the driver-side door. West then fires at the other officers as he runs across the busy street. Boston Police Commissioner William Evans pointed out that he was firing 'under his arm' at the other cops. The video shows Boston police officer John Moynihan, circled in white, opening the driver-side door to talk to Angelo West after the car was pulled over during a gunfire investigation . West then immediately jumps out of the car and shoots Moynihan in the face at close range . Officer Moynihan , 34, was released from the hospital Friday after weeks of recovery. The Boston Police Department described his current condition as 'serious but improving' The video, captured from the surveillance camera of a nearby store, shows the beginning of the shootout that led to officers firing the fatal shots that killed West. 'This particular incident we had no other choice,' Evans said about the fatal shooting. 'He had already used deadly force, trying to kill one of my officers, and the officers did what they were trained to do.' During a press conference, Evans said the video shows that the officers did not have their weapons drawn or have their hands their hands on their weapons when they approached West's car. Suffolk District Attorney Daniel F. Conley said it was important to release the video to show the community exactly what happened - and why. 'In those instances in which video evidence can inform the public... it is in everyone's best interest to share that information as soon as possible,' Conley said during the press conference. The district attorney said such transparency was necessary to 'tamp down speculation and rumors meant to inflame and not to inform'. 'Our goal going forward is to ensure that we are one people and one city,' he said. Evans said Moynihan had seen the video. Angelo West was fatally shot by Moynihan's colleagues during the shoot-out. Boston Police Commissioner William Evans said that 'during this particular incident' the officers had no other choice . The video shows how West fired at the other officers after shooting Moynihan while he ran across the street . 'He probably realizes he's really lucky to be talking at this point, to be shot so suddenly with a .357 Magnum in the face and to be around talking about it, and hopefully to make as much of a full recovery as we think he's going to,' he said during the conference, captured by WCVB. But Evans said 'there are no winners here'. 'We have an officer who was seriously injured, and we have a family who is grieving the loss of a loved one,' he said. Moynihan was released from the hospital yesterday after weeks of recovering from the gunshot wound. His condition was described as 'serious but improving' in a statement released by the Boston Police Department. The statement said Moynihan wanted to 'thank and acknowledge the officers on scene for their lightening quick reaction and response that he credits for saving his life'. Moynihan is a highly decorated military veteran awarded a medal for bravery by President Obama for his involvement in a shoot-out with the Boston Bombing suspects.

Moynihan and five other officers approached West's car to speak to one of his two passengers, alleged gang member Dennis Wilson Jr. There were reports of gunfire near where Wilson lived and he was tracked down using the GPS coordinates of a bracelet he had to wear while on bail for unrelated charges, according to the Boston Globe. The officers stopped the SUV in two unmarked police vehicles and headed to the car so they could remove Wilson and West's second passenger Jonathan Aguasvivas, who was wanted on unrelated domestic violence charges.

88,"His penchant for topless scything has proved a hit with housewives around the UK - and sent many rushing to social media to declare their love for actor Aidan Turner, 31. But it seems not everyone is a fan of the gardening techniques featured on Poldark - not least the mowing community who have complained about Turner's 'excessive sweating and grunting' and say it should never be done shirtless. Turner set hearts aflutter when he stripped off to manfully mow a hay field with a scythe, an ancient cutting tool used for centuries prior to horse drawn and modern mowing machinery. Scroll down for video . More like Iggy Pop: Scything expert Chris Riley says his own physique is more like rocker Iggy Pop . But while the sexy scene helped send audience ratings through the roof, it prompted a scathing critique from a band of enthusiasts dedicated to keeping the age-old art alive. They say Turner’s macho grunts and terrible technique as he hacked at the hay tarnished the view of the usually 'sedate' action of scything. Expert scyther Chris Riley, 56, says in real life, Turner would have run out of breath long before completing the filed - and he would have kept his shirt on to protect him from the sun. 'When the Poldark episode in question aired, word got around our network of scythe enthusiasts very quickly that there had been this scene in it where Aidan Turner used a scythe,' he says. 'It was accompanied by a lot of comments saying his technique wasn’t very good. The story of Poldark highlights the romantic aspect of the scythe and its use in history but we weren’t very impressed with Aidan Turner’s scything.. That's how it's done: Mr Riley demonstrates how scything should really be done . Surely not? Mr Riley brushed off comparisons with Poldark and compared himself to Iggy Pop instead . That's more like it: Aidan Turner's shirtless Poldark has been setting hearts aflutter on Sunday nights . 'There was a lot of sweating and grunting going on but the only time you’d mow like that would be in a competition.' Mr Riley, from Gillingham in Dorset, also questioned whether Turner had been shown how to use a scythe properly before the cameras rolled. 'Scything is an efficient and poetic way of cutting rather than the way it was portrayed on Poldark where it was this very aggressive, manly action. 'Using a scythe should be a sedate, pleasurable activity rather than an arduous, backbreaking chore. It can be zen-like if you’ve got a sharp blade and good technique. 'That was how the programme makers wanted to portray it but it was clear to us that there wasn’t much effective work being done. 'The grass and flowers in the meadow weren’t flying everywhere, which you might expect if someone was good with a scythe. 'I would guess that Aiden Turner had not been shown how to use a scythe properly before filming. If an experienced scyther were to put the same amount of energy into it as on Poldark they’d be getting an awful lot done. 'A work rate like that is also not conducive to keeping the action up all day, but that was obviously in conflict with how producers wanted the scene to look.' Mr Riley also raised questions about Turner’s lack of shirt, claiming a real scyther would keep their clothes on to protect them from the elements. Exhausting: Mr Riley says Poldark puts too much effort into his scything and wouldn't  finish the job . Smooth move: Fellow expert Simon Fairlie, from Dorset, shows off his skills in a West Country meadow . The 56-year-old, who runs courses in how to wield a scythe, added: 'The fact that he had no top on was not particularly realistic - if you were in the field all day and wanted to protect yourself from the sun you wouldn’t take your shirt off. 'There are times when it is OK to scythe topless, like if you are in competition, but I’m more Iggy Pop than Aiden Turner.' Meanwhile... Female fans take to Twitter to complain about the lack of shirtless mowing in last night's episode of Poldark . Female fans of BBC One's Cornish period drama Poldark are complaining after dashing actor Aidan Turner kept his shirt on in last night's penultimate episode. Many have taken to Twitter to voice their upset after the Irish hunk, who plays Captain Poldark, went a whole episode without revealing his chest. In previous episodes the star has been seen scything topless and skinny dipping in the Cornish sea. Where are the abs? Fans were disappointed by the lack of topless action in last night's Poldark . Recap: Poldark has appeared topless in nearly every episode and is seen here in episode three . Memorable: Episode two featured Aidan Turner taking a naked swim in crystal clear Cornish waters . Last night the BBC continuity announcer said there would be 'distressing scenes' as one of the characters is murdered, but many women joked it was 'distressing' seeing Turner fully clothed. One fan named Stacey tweeted: 'Distressing scenes my arse. Only 'cos he kept his clothes on all night #Poldark.' Verthless added: 'Despite the @BBCOne warning before #Poldark my wife is traumatised by some of the scenes in which Aiden Turner kept his shirt on.' Jacqui Walls posted: 'All bad news on the #Poldark front tonight. @Aidan Turner didn't get his shirt off once.' Others complained about the lack of any obvious carer for Captain Poldark and Demelza's baby Julia because she was absent from most of the scenes. Although Poldark sacks his servants Jud and Prudie, Demelza is later seen visiting Francis and going for cliff top walks without her baby daughter. 'Can someone tell me who looks after #Poldark's baby @BBCOne,' tweeted MursMums. Cross: A viewer complained that the real source of distress was a lack of shirtlessness . Traumatic: Viewers had been hoping that Poldark would take his top off - but had no such luck . Compensation: One concluded that at least Poldark's trademark smoulder had been left in place . Denouement: Next week's finale will reveal whether Ross and Francis manage to patch up their quarrel . Fired: Other viewers questioned who was doing the childcare following Jud and Prudie's sacking . Gallery 45 tweeted: 'It's all very good swooning over Ross, but we have some serious concerns for the welfare of Baby Julia! #homealone.' Others joined a growing chorus of fans who want the series to continue beyond the final episode which airs next Sunday. Fenteroon Hol Cotts tweeted: 'Have a feeling there's be lots of tears shed next Sunday eve, approx 10pm.' Caley added: 'I genuinely don't know what I'm going to do after nxt wk. First #fortitude ends, now #Poldark.' Heidi wrote: 'Can't believe #Poldark is near the end its been the highlight of my weekends!!!!' Jaime Watson posted: 'Can't believe it's the last #Poldark next week. How am I going to survive without seeing @AidanTurner every Sunday?' Another, Hannah, tweeted: 'Last episode of #Poldark next week. Sad times. I like my weekly Aidan Turner fix.' Luckily for fans of the 18th century mining drama and Mr Turner, the BBC announced last week that it has commissioned a second series of Poldark.","Chris Riley, 56, from Dorset, says Turner has the technique all wrong .

89,"A marathon runner who parked his car before taking part in the race has found it again  nine days after the 26 mile event following a public appeal. Jason Matthews, 40, left his black Saab 93 in a side street on his way to the starting line of the Manchester Marathon on April 19. But when the runner from Wolverhampton finished the race after five hours 11 minutes of running he was unable to remember where he had parked it. Jason Matthews, 40, (pictured after the race) lost his car after parking up before the Manchester Marathon on April 19 and is about to be reunited with it after a Good Samaritan gave up his day off to join the search . Mr Matthews spent hours searching for his missing car, even retracing some of the marathon route before enlisting the help of a taxi driver to help him. He spent 40 minutes driving through the area of the city surrounding Manchester United's Old Trafford ground before going to a police station to ask for help, but eventually had to give up and get a train back to his home in the Midlands. However, his car has now been found safe and sound by Adam Coppin from Salford, who read of Mr Matthews's plight and decided to use his day off to help. Mr Coppin, 32, spent this morning searching for Mr Matthews's car and found it safe and sound in an office car park in Salford Quays. 'I've been in similar situations parking at work, then forgetting what floor of the multi-storey I've parked on and walking around for ages,' said Mr Coppin, who works as a technical advisor at MediaCityUK. 'I could imagine his frustration, especially after running a marathon. 'I read the story on Monday night and had an idea from the description where it might be. 'As I had today off, I decided to go out and look for it and managed to find it. 'There is no damage apart from a few blossoms falling down on it from the tree above. I'm glad I could help.' Mr Matthews left his black Saab 93, similar to this model, in a side street close to Manchester United's Old Trafford ground before the race . Mr Matthews, a delivery driver for a builders' merchants, said he could remember driving into Manchester up Princess Parkway and then onto the Mancunian Way, before taking the A56 towards Trafford on his way to the race. He then remembers driving past Old Trafford on his left before parking up in a car park on a side street near a small office block. Mr Matthews, who was competing in the Manchester Marathon for the first time, said: 'The area looked like a small estate and there were chaps with high vis vests waving people in. 'I did the race then walked back past Old Trafford and looked around for about an hour. 'I actually ended up walking part of the course again. 'Then I spent about 40 minutes in a taxi and we looked all around near the Imperial War Museum but couldn't find it. Mr Matthews had searched this area of Manchester during the hunt for his missing car . 'I went to the police station and there was another chap and a lady there in exactly the same position.' Mr Matthews, who has competed in nine other marathons, added: 'I was that worn out, I was just anxious and annoyed. Manchester council had told him there was no record of the vehicle, which had a silver bike rack attached to it, being towed or impounded. Grateful Mr Matthews said he was so relieved to be reunited with the vehicle that he wants to make a donation to a charity of Mr Coppin's choice in order to say thank you. He plans to travel to Manchester tomorrow to retrieve his vehicle. 'I am so relieved, it's a massive burden lifted off me,' he said. 'I'm so glad I don't have to go out looking for it again or buy a new car. I am so grateful to this chap for finding it for me.

90,"Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola weathered his first major crisis at the German club after his team crushed Porto 7-4 on aggregate on Tuesday to move into the Champions League last four. The Spaniard in his second season in charge was with his back to the wall after their surprise 3-1 first leg defeat in Portugal last week. Never had one of his teams lost before the semi-finals in the competition but that prospect suddenly seemed real. Bayern Munich celebrate in front of their delighted fans after overturning a first leg deficit to reach semi-finals . Thiago Alcantara jumps highest to head the home side in front on 14 minutes and set the Bayern on their way . Damned to succeed, Guardiola repeatedly said he was aware of what he needed to deliver at the five-time European champions for who a league and German Cup double was just not enough. He arrived at Bayern after their 2013 treble-winning season and expectations have not been lowered since. A semi-final exit last season only heightened pressure on Guardiola to deliver another treble this time round. But plagued by injuries in recent months and a rare internal strife after long-time team doctor Hans-Wilhelm Mueller-Wohlfahrt quit after 38 years, saying his medical team was blamed for the loss to Porto, Bayern had a far-from-perfect preparation. The doctor is hugely respected by Bayern players with many saying they would continue taking his advice and Guardiola suddenly in the firing line for allegedly falling out with a Bayern icon. Pep Guardiola said after the game that winning is a matter of life and death at Bayern . Robert Lewandowski made it three on 27 minutes as the Poland striker powerfully nodded the ball into the net . Failure to advance against Porto would have added to an already difficult week and would no doubt fan speculation about the coach's future in Munich despite having a contract to 2016. With Premier League clubs circling, a slip-up on Tuesday could prove decisive for both the club and the coach. But the Spaniard, who won 14 titles in his four seasons at Barcelona, thrived under adverse conditions with his team playing arguably their best game this season, even without injured Arjen Robben, Franck Ribery, Bastian Schweinsteiger and David Alaba. Bayern frontman is congratulated by Mario Gotze (left), defender Rafinha (centre) and Thomas Muller . 'I felt it in the last few days that we would advance,' Guardiola said after Bayern fired five goals in 26 first-half minutes. 'This is about life or death and I know how very important it was,' he said. 'I know what is expected of me in this team. It is about winning just like at Barcelona.' Fans are now dreaming of a trophy on German soil in June's final in Berlin and with players gradually returning from injury, Guardiola is confident Bayern will further improve. 'We can play even better,' he said in what is no doubt a warning to other title contenders. 'After the loss in Porto the players were my heroes. Now it's easy to love them.'","Bayern Munich beat Porto 6-1 in the Champions League quarter-final .

91,"It's the nation famed for its gastronomy which gave birth to haute cuisine and the Michelin Guide . But almost three quarters of all dishes served in French bistros, brasseries and cafes are shipped in from a factory and microwaved, according to a top restaurateur. Xavier Denamur sparked fury after he exposed France as a country of microwave cheats and even went as far as to compare it as being the culinary equivalent of a low-cost airline. Xavier Denamur sparked fury after he exposed France as a country of microwave cheats and even went as far as to compare chefs' corner-cutting as being the culinary equivalent of a low-cost airline . 'The microwave has become the chef's best friend,' he told The Times. Unesco has named France's 'gastronomic meal' a world treasure and the country still welcomes more tourists than any other nation. But there are signs that its crown as the world's culinary king has been slipping for some time. Last year, the country that gave us the croissant, coq au vin and moules mariníères, as well as introducing the concept of L'apéritif, did not get a single entry in to the top ten of the World's 50 Best Restaurant Awards. Xavier Denamur has claimed that almost three quarters of all meals served in French bistros, brasseries and cafes are shipped in from a factory and microwaved . Instead the list was dominated by Spain, the UK, USA, Brazil with Denmark as number one, with only five French restaurants making it into the awards at all. The French government was so concerned they called on two multi-Michelin-starred chefs to draw up battle plans. But even chefs Alain Ducasse and Guy Savoy, who have now put together a 20-point plan, admitted that France's global culinary influence 'is no longer the same'. They added that France's mid-to-low range restaurants, particularity in tourist traps like Mont Saint Michel or the banks of the Seine, let the country down. The chefs recommended stricter criteria should also be introduced on food with the 'home-made' label in restaurants which currently allows most frozen and vacuum-packed food. A survey by catering union Synhorcat in 2014 suggested 31 per cent of restaurants (not including cafeterias, bars and fast food outlets) used industrially prepared foods. But Mr Denamur, who revealed the trade secrets in his book Et si on se mettait enfin a table? (And if We Sat Down to Eat at Last?) claimed the figures were as high as seven in ten dishes served in cafes, brasseries and bistros were made in a factory and re-heated. In his book he said the dominant low cost model imposed by the 'greedy' producers of frozen food has 'trapped independent restaurants and sacked the planet.' Last year the French government passed a law which was meant to force restaurants to label the dishes they prepare from fresh ingredients in their own kitchens as 'fait maison' (homemade). But ministers have been forced to admit that the law had failed as diners had little faith in the new label. Commerce minister Carole Delga said the scheme was meant to promote traditional cooking and those establishments that cook from scratch. A survey by catering union Synhorcat in 2014 suggested 31 per cent of restaurants (not including cafeterias, bars and fast food outlets) used industrially prepared foods (stock picture) A new law to try and promote freshly made dishes has been criticised as chefs are still able to buy in read-made ingredients . She claimed the fait maison logo would 'allow all, at a glance, to distinguish food that has been assembled from industrially prepared elements from cuisine created from raw produce'. But the new law was criticised for not going far enough as restaurants were still able to use ingredients such as factory-made pastry and claim the food was homemade. Mr Denamur, who starred in République de Malbouffe (Republic of Junk Food), a documentary investigating the state of French food said he had been 'bitterly disappointed' by the label. 'I chop all my steak tartare to order, but someone who buys it in, vacuum packed in a controlled atmosphere, where it might have come from 10 different cows, can call theirs fait maison too. It's ridiculous,' he told the Guardian last year. 'If you can't make the base for a sauce, don't make one. Don't use an industrial one – that's not real cooking, it's not fait maison.' Mrs Delga has now pledged to tighten up the rules around the law. Star chefs Alain Ducasse (right) and Guy Savoy (left) will be putting together a 20-point plan for the 'gastrono-diplomacy' report to try and repair France's reputation . The rising cost of raw materials and staff may be partly to blame for putting cooking from scratch beyond the reach of many restaurants. A traditional boeuf bourguignon costs as much as 7.50 Euros to produce, according to the restaurateur who owns four French bistros. It is often much cheaper for chefs to simply buy frozen ingredients and ready-made dishes from industrial producers such as Transgourmet, Métro, Brake or Davigel. Last month, the French ministry launch the Good France project which saw 1,000 chefs of different nationalities serve French food and wine in restaurants and embassies across five continents as part of its national 'gastrono-diplomacy' drive. The elaborate four course meals aimed to emulate those of celebrated 19th century cook and culinary ambassador Georges August Escoffier.","Xavier Denamur claims most dishes in French bistro aren't made on site .

92,"Jesus Christ was not a real person and is probably the result of a combination of stories about several different individuals, according to a writer and leading atheist activist. David Fitzgerald, a San Francisco based author, believes he has compiled compelling evidence that proves Jesus did not exist. He claims there are no contemporary mentions of Jesus in historical accounts from the time when he was supposed to have lived, yet other Jewish sect leaders from the time do appear. Scroll down for video . Mystery: This painting depicts Jesus Christ as single person but writer David Fitzgerald believes he was a literary invention that combined the stories from several cults and figures in Judea during the first century . He also points to discrepancies in the early gospels of Mark, Matthew and Luke, claiming these were written decades after the supposed time of Jesus. Instead he insists the disciples of Jesus were also probably not real and their names only later attached to the gospels to lend them credence. Historical researcher Michael Paulkovich has claimed that Jesus of Nazareth did not exist after being unable to find any verifiable mention of Christ in historical texts by 126 writers during the ‘time of Jesus’ from the first to third centuries. He claims that he is a fictional character invented by followers of Christianity to create a figure to worship. He says this is surprising despite his ‘global miracles and alleged worldwide fame.’ The 126 texts he studied were all written in the period during or soon after the supposed existence of Jesus, when Paulkovich says they would surely have heard of someone as famous as Jesus - but none mention him. 'When I consider those 126 writers, all of whom should have heard of Jesus but did not - and Paul and Marcion and Athenagoras and Matthew with a tetralogy of opposing Christs, the silence from Qumram and Nazareth and Bethlehem, conflicting Bible stories, and so many other mysteries and omissions - I must conclude that Christ is a mythical character,’ he writes. ‘""Jesus of Nazareth"" was nothing more than urban (or desert) legend, likely an agglomeration of several evangelic and deluded rabbis who might have existed.’ In a new book due to be published later this year, he will argue that the figure of Jesus was actually a combination of pagan rituals and stories about other people. Speaking to MailOnline, he said: 'There is a paradox that Jesus did all these amazing things and taught all these amazing things yet no one heard of him outside his immediate cult for nearly 100 years. 'Or it means he didn't do all these things at all. 'The first gospel of Christianity appears to have been a literary allegory that were written decades after the time they portray. 'I believe that Christianity started as one of the many mystery faiths that appeared at the time where old Gods and old traditions were rebooted. 'Christianity appears to have been a Jewish mystery faith. 'By the time of Paul there appears to have been plenty of different ""Lord's suppers"" as he complains about the existence of other gospels and messiahs. 'It appears that early Christianity managed to take the stories from these other faiths and incorporate them into the story of Jesus.' Mr Fitzgerald, whose first book 'Nailed: Ten Christian Myths that Show Jesus Never Existed at All' was published in 2010, believes it is no longer reasonable to assume there has to be a single historic figure who began Christianity. Instead he says early Christians drew upon the beliefs and rituals of other cults and faiths around in the first century. He argues that John the Baptist's cult is one such example and had initially been a competitor to the cult of Jesus before being incorporated into the Christian story. Mr Fitzgerald says there are inconsistencies in the Gospels of the Christian bible (pictured above) that suggest Jesus Christ was a literary allegory and these accounts were written decades after his supposed life . The statue of Christ the Redeemer (above) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is one of many depictions of Jesus but Mr Fitzgerald says that many of the early depictions were unable to agree on his appearance . Mr Fitzgerald said: 'There is nothing implausible to think that Jesus was a real person, but I just don't think that he can have been a single person if he existed at all. 'We also have no mention of Jesus in other historical texts from the time. There were certainly people writing about Judea at the time like Philo of Alexandria. 'During this period there were many other messiahs and wannabe messiahs who did far less exciting things than Jesus, but all of them managed something Jesus did not - to make a dent on the historical record. 'Two billion people believe all these miracles happened yet there is no evidence they did.' The earliest mention of Jesus yet to be discovered is a limestone ossuary on which the words 'James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus' is inscribed. The box, which has been dated to 64AD - several decades after the crucifixion - was seized by the Israeli Antiquities Authority and its owner arrested for forgery in 2003. Although he was later cleared in 2012, doubts about the authenticity of the inscription remain. Others have said there could have been several people named James, whose father was called Joseph and had a brother called Jesus living in Jerusalem at the time. The James Ossuary (above) is thought by some to be the first mention of Jesus in an inscription on its side . There are three mentions of Jesus in non-Christian sources which have been used to research the existence of a 'real' Jesus. A Jesus is mentioned in Josephus' Antiquities of the Jews, which was written around 94 AD. Rather than being born in a stable to a carpenter father, Jesus was actually the son of a successful, middle-class and highly intellectual architect. This claim comes from biblical scholar Dr Adam Bradford, who also says that between the ages of 12 and 30 - the so-called 'missing years' of Jesus' life, when little is known about him - he was studying at religious schools and became the highest-ranking rabbi in Judea. The radical revision of Christian history would suggest that, in preaching the spurning of worldly possessions for an austere life, Jesus may have been speaking from experience. Dr Bradford has analysed the Bible's original Greek and Hebrew scriptures to try to establish the truth about Christ's background. He says a mistranslation of the Greek word 'tekton' to describe the profession of Joseph, Jesus's father, is one of many mistakes that have led to a fundamental misunderstanding of Christ's character. Dr Bradford claims that while 'tekton' is usually said to mean carpenter, it more accurately means master builder or architect. As an architect, Joseph would have had a higher social status that enabled him to better educate his son. Roman historian Tacitus later mentions Christ and his execution with Pontius Pilate in his Annals, thought to be written around 116AD. Both mentions were a considerable time after his alleged execution. Mr Fritzgerald also takes issue with many of the stories about the Crucifixion that stem from the first Gospels of Mark, Matthew and Luke. He said: 'There are many examples of inconsistencies in the gospels that suggest they were written by people who did not live in Judea at the time they are set. 'Mark makes many mistakes about life and geography during the first century in Judea. 'If Jesus really had been arrested on the eve of Passover, they would probably have just put him in jail and tried him after the weekend. 'The trial itself violates the rules of Jewish law - why was he not stoned? 'What we know about Pontius Pilate also suggests he was someone who would not do what the Jews asked him and would often do what they asked him not to. 'Instead Mark portrays him as being persuaded by the Jewish leaders to execute him.' Mr Fitzgerald argues that many of these stories were in fact incorporated into the story of Christ as literary devices rather than as a historical account. He said: 'There is also no evidence for the tradition that sees Barabbas - an anti-Roman rebel and murderer - being released while Jesus, an innocent, is condemned to death. 'What this actually seems to be is Mark using the story as an allegory for the Yom Kippur scapegoat ritual where one goat is released into the wilderness and the other is sacrificed for God.' Mr Fitzgerald hopes to have his new book 'Jesus: Mything in Action' out later this year. He added: 'It still puzzles me that as soon as anyone tries to pin down who Jesus is we get 50 different Jesus's emerging. There is no consensus.'","Atheist writer David Fitzgerald claims there is no evidence Jesus existed .

Fitzgerald also highlights inconsistencies in the Gospels, suggesting they were written decades after Jesus's supposed life and incorporate pagan rituals and existing narratives. He believes early Christians drew upon these beliefs and stories to create the figure of Jesus.  Fitzgerald emphasizes the absence of evidence for Jesus' miracles and the numerous discrepancies in accounts of his life and death.

However Vincent was forced to step down because of poor health. He maintained a distinctive appearance, wearing a bathrobe and slippers around the streets of New York in a bid to look insane, so he could avoid prosecution - a scheme he later admitted to.

94,"If the team with momentum hold an ace card heading into the play-offs, then watch out for Wolves. Kenny Jackett’s team moved into sixth place in the Championship with a fourth successive victory after David Edwards, the substitute, headed home two minutes from the end of an unpredictable and thrilling game. Pre-match results had offered Wolves a prospective route into the play-off zone, with Brentford and Ipswich Town dropping points unexpectedly, and Kenny Jackett reflected the burgeoning confidence within Molineux by naming an unchanged starting line-up from the side that prevailed 2-1 at Nottingham Forest on Friday for a third successive victory.

Booked: Wooton, Byram, Bamba . Goal: Taylor 11, Batth OG 65, Mowatt 74 . Referee: David Coote . Attendance: 25,169 . With a day less to recover, Leeds had also been on a decent run before Saturday’s 3-0 home defeat by Blackburn Rovers topped another distressing chapter in their tumultuous recent history. Neil Redfearn, the head coach, had said he would consider his future after this game at Wolves after his assistant Steve Thompson had been suspended without explanation. Although Massimon Cellini, Leeds’ banned owner, has subsequently claimed Thomson had used abusive language towards sporting director Nicola Salerno, it was only another spanner in the works for this once-proud club who need stability more than anything. Still, it was Leeds who struck the first blow, courtesy of a poor defensive clearance from Kevin McDonald who, penned back towards his own corner flag by debutant Kalvin Phillips, attempted a loose clearance that cannoned off Richard Stearman, his own team-mate, for Charlie Taylor to sidefoot under Carl Ikeme. Even before the January arrival of Benik Afobe, now level with Harry Kane as the leading goalscorer in all four divisions, Wolves have happily relied on either and both of the Mali combination of Bakary Sako and Nouha Dicko. It was the latter who earned Jackett’s team the lead by half-time. Dicko equalised from the tightest of angles when a cross-shot from Afobe, all loping legs and dizzying stepovers, eluded Marco Silvestri. It still needed a cute finish as the former Wigan striker lifted his shot over Scott Wootton from the byline for his 12th goal of an increasingly impressive season. Alex Mowatt looks delighted after putting Leeds back on level terms by scoring his side's third goal . Wolves goalkeeper Carl Ikeme  dives in vain as Mowatt makes it 3-3 before Edwards' late winner . Leeds attempted to disrupt Wolves’ rhythm with some fiercely competitive tackling, Phillips receiving one caution for fouling McDonald then fortunate not to be dismissed for a foul that ripped holes in the former Sheffield United midfielder’s sock. The home side started to put together the pieces of their flowing passing game as half-time approached however and, in stoppage time, Leeds conceded at what appeared to be the worst time. Their defence appeared to disappear as Sako played in Dicko who took his time before firing in off the near post. Wolves turned the screw at the start of the second half as Afobe joined in the goalscoring fun three minutes after the restart. The former Arsenal striker, who scored 19 times on loan for MK Dons in the first half of the season, attempted an audacious overhead kick from Jack Price’s cross into the area. Sako kept play alive, dropping the ball back for Batth, whose shot hit Dicko but fell back for Afobe to smash in his tenth goal for Wolves. Leeds looked as if they might capitulate at this stage before Wolves offered them a lifeline back into the game in the 66th minute. Alex Mowatt’s dink into the penalty area looked pretty harmless and a cry of ‘leave it’ could be heard from the press box, presumably from Ikeme, only for Batth to lunge and divert the ball past his own goalkeeper. Richard Stearman was the next guilty party in the Wolves defence as he gave the ball away cheaply to Mowatt who cut inside and from outside the penalty area curled home a superb equaliser into the top corner. Wolves do possess strength in depth however and in David Edwards they have a midfielder who not only works as hard as anyone in pressing the ball but also chips in with crucial goals. So it was that the substitute rose two minutes from time to head McDonald’s telling cross into the top corner to wrap up the win that took Wolves into sixth place.

96,"Shabana Bibi, died in hospital on Saturday April 18 . The heartbroken brother of Pakistan's latest 'honour killing victim' - allegedly burned alive because she left the house without permission - said he will set himself alight if he does not get justice. Shabana Bibi, 25, from the Muzaffargarh district of the country, died in hospital on Saturday after suffering burns to 80 per cent of her body. Police have arrested her husband Muhammad Siddique and father-in-law Pir Bakhsh. Bibi's brother, Muhammad Azam said Siddique became enraged on learning his wife had visited her sister without first asking him if she could go out. His father then beat Bibi before dousing her with petrol on April 17, Azam alleged. Bibi had been married to Siddique for three years, during which time she had suffered repeated domestic abuse because the couple couldn't have children, her brother claimed. Azam says police have not provided him with a copy of the crime report despite repeated requests. 'I would set myself on fire in front of the office of the district police chief if I did not get justice,' he said. District police chief Rai Zameer-ul-Haq said: 'We have arrested the husband and father-in-law of the deceased woman and charged them for murder and terrorism.' The charge of 'terrorism' is regularly applied in such cases to quicken the legal process. Bibi (not pictured) had been married to Siddique for three years, during which time she had suffered repeated domestic abuse, according to her brother . But Naseem, the investigating officer, now says police have no doubt Bibi committed suicide. He said the police investigation will end if three people from the area take an oath on the Quran claiming Bakhsh is innocent. He said police have asked the men to visit the police station tomorrow so the oaths can be made. Hundreds of women are murdered by their relatives in Pakistan each year through domestic violence or on the grounds of defending family 'honour'. The Aurat Foundation, a campaign group that works to improve the lives of women in Pakistan's conservative and patriarchal society, says more than 3,000 women have been killed in such attacks since 2008.","Shabana Bibi, 25, died after she suffered burns to 80 per cent of her body .

97,"A 25-year-old man left brain damaged as a baby after a blunder by doctors has today won his 23-year battle for £7.3 million compensation. The young man, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, now relies on 24-hour care. He was born at the Luton and Dunstable Hospital in September 1989, but was readmitted three months later, suffering a serious brain haemorrhage. Maternity staff at the hospital failed to administer a vitamin K injection shortly after the man was born. A 25-year-old man was left brain damaged as a baby after doctors at the Luton and Dunstable Hospital failed to administer a vitamin K injection to help the blood clot and prevent internal bleeding. He now requires 24-hour care and will do for the rest of his life. (File picture) The booster is given to newborn babies to reduce their risk of blood clots. The Secretary of State for Health admitted liability, accepting the failure to give the man vitamin K breached their duty of care. At London's High Court today, Judge Michael Yelton approved the £7.3 million settlement, to be paid by the NHS Litigation Authority. It awards the man a lump sum of £2,345,000, as well as annual payments of £181,000, rising to £192,000 - making a total of £7,385,000. Vitamin K helps the blood to clot, and as a result can prevent excessive internal bleeding. In the UK new parents are asked if they would like their newborn to recieve the supplement. Babies are born with low levels of the vitamin, but the amount is normally enough to prevent problems. Some babies are at greater risk, and are more likely to suffer haemorrhagic disease of the newborn, also known as vitamin K deficiency bleeding. Because it can be difficult to ascertain which babies are at heightened risk, the Department of Health recommends all babies receive the supplement soon after birth. Though rare, HDN is a very serious disease. Half of all babies with HDN suffer a haemorrhage into their brain, often resulting in brain damage. Babies at higher risk of HDN include: . Source: NCT . Judge Yelton said the man should not be named because he was a 'vulnerable person'. But he said he was 'entirely satisfied' the settlement was in his best interests. He said he was 'very pleased' for the young man and his family. The brain damage the now 25-year-old suffered has resulted in significant cognitive and physical problems, including a weakness on his left hand side, and reduced hearing. He also lacks the capacity to manage his own affairs, and needs round the clock care. His family welcomed the settlement, adding it will allow for specialist support, specially adapted accommodation and 24-hour care. His solicitor Arani Yogadeva of Irwin Mitchell said: 'Vitamin K injections are offered to parents as a measure to boost their newborn baby's anti-clotting processes shortly after birth and reduce the risks of them suffering excessive bleeding caused by a deficiently in the vitamin. 'In this case, midwives and doctors chose not to provide him with the relevant dose without advising his mother about the vitamin and the importance of it - a decision which has had serious repercussions. 'We are delighted to have helped the family secure vital financial support, along with an admission of liability.

98,"The days of filling your car with petrol may be numbered because researchers have boosted the efficiency of making hydrogen fuel from plant waste. US scientists have found a way to use discarded corn husks and stalks to make cheap hydrogen fuel that doesn't pollute the environment like fossil fuels. The breakthrough could one day see the fuel being produced locally and drivers stopping to refuel their vehicles at roadside bioreactors instead of pumping petrol into their motor. US scientists have found a way to use discarded corn husks and stalks to make cheap hydrogen fuel that doesn't pollute the environment like fossil fuels and it could accelerate the take up of biogas for cars . Eco-friendly hydrogen cars, which are already a reality, emit only water, but the gas is expensive and is not easy to store, meaning more research is needed for  hydrogen cars to become mainstream. Now, researchers at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University have shown that it’s possible to convert 100 per cent of the sugar in corn stalks and husks – a by-product of farming – into hydrogen gas, which can be used to power vehicles. It’s previously only been possible to convert between 30 and 60 per cent of plant sugar into hydrogen, by using industrial catalysts or fermenting techniques, The Independent reported. The ultimate aim is to produce large quantities of hydrogen from crop waste efficiently, because many present methods either cost too much or use food crops. The breakthrough could one day see the fuel being produced locally and drivers stopping to refuel their vehicles at roadside bioreactors instead of pumping petrol into their motor. For years, scientists have been working out how to develop fuel cell cars powered by pure hydrogen, but are unsure how to store the substance effectively. Now, researchers from India's Benaras Hindu University may be close to solving this problem using coconut kernels to store hydrogen in gas form. Storing liquid hydrogen is notoriously difficult as it must be held at extremely low temperatures, which is expensive and tricky in the confines of a car. To store it in its gaseous state, would mean that vehicles would have to be fitted with large, pressurised tanks, which is not practical. So instead, experts have focused on finding materials, such as carbon, which can absorb hydrogen and release it on demand. Professor Viney Dixit and his team, at the university’s Hydrogen Energy Centre created carbon from coconut kernels, which contain fatty and organic acids as well as potassium, magnesium and sodium. He says that the kernels, which are easily found, are cheap and can easily be converted into carbon. ‘Unlike graphene, Carbon nano tubes (CNTs) and other type of carbons, the production of carbon from solid endosperm is not time taking, he wrote in a research paper. ‘Therefore, its cost-effectiveness, good adsorption capacity and easy availability are its advantageous factors in regard to hydrogen storage.’ The researchers found that the carbon produced from the kernels could store a ‘considerable’ amount of hydrogen. Two scientists developed a process to make more efficient fuel by mixing biomass with a special solution comprising 10 enzymes that turn plant sugars into hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The enzymes were created in microbial fermenters using genetically engineered bacteria, which were then added to the plant waste and left for several weeks – although they would be left for far longer if the fuel was produced on a large scale. The breakthrough could produce a zero-emissions fuel that could speed up the movement toward hydrogen-powered vehicles, according to the study, which was published in the journal PNAS. ‘We have demonstrated the most important step toward a hydrogen economy -- producing distributed and affordable green hydrogen from local biomass resources,’ said study co-author Percival Zhang, a professor at Virginia Tech. Together with former doctoral student Joe Rollin, he founded a start-up called Cell-free Bioinnovations to work on the fuel. The process builds on previous research using xylose, ‘the most abundant simple plant pentose sugar, to produce hydrogen yields that previously were attainable only in theory,’ according to the study. Other hydrogen fuel production methods rely on highly processed sugars, but the Virginia Tech team used corn husks and stalks, which are known as dirty biomass, to cut costs and make the fuel easier to produce locally. Dr Rollin found that the process of breaking down corn husks and stalks into hydrogen and carbon dioxide can use both sugars glucose and xylose at the same time - not one after the other. The discovery means it is possible to speed up the rate at which hydrogen is released, while decreasing the area of the facility needed to produce it to the size of a gas station. Other hydrogen fuel production methods rely on highly processed sugars, but the Virginia Tech team used corn husks and stalks, (a stock image of the whole plantis shown) which are known as dirty biomass, to cut costs and make the fuel easier to produce locally . ‘We believe this exciting technology has the potential to enable the widespread use of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles around the world and displace fossil fuels,’ Dr Rollin said. Experts say it is hard to know how much the new approach might cost, but Lonnie Ingram, director of the Florida Centre for Renewable Chemicals and Fuels at the University of Florida - who was not involved with the study - said the work ‘represents a revolutionary approach that offers many new advantages. ‘These researchers have certainly broadened the scope of our thinking about metabolism and how it plays into the future of alternative energy production,’ he said. Researchers say they have the necessary cash to scale up their findings to a demonstration-level, which is the next step of the project. Professor Zhang said: ‘I think in three to five years we should be able to build a bioreactor that is something like a gas station which can produce 200 kilos of hydrogen fuel a day. ‘This would be enough to re-fuel about 40 or 50 cars.’","Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University researchers found a way to use discarded corn husks and stalks to make cheap hydrogen fuel .

99,"A former air stewardess who was struck down by a devastating illness is making her catwalk debut today in a wheelchair. Gemma Flanagan, 31, from Liverpool, was left paralysed after suddenly being hit by Guillain Barre Syndrome, a rare condition which attacks the nervous system. The aspiring model was working for British Airways when the condition first struck. But the aspiring model, 31, isn't letting that hold her back as she makes her catwalk debut today . Air hostess Gemma Flanagan, pictured strengthening her legs, left, and in a wheelchair, right, was left paralysed after being hit by Guillain Barre Syndrome . She said: 'I had just come back from Las Vegas and felt odd, like I was jet-lagged. My legs were heavy and I had pins and needles.' Gemma assumed partying in six-inch heels during her stopover was the cause of the pain in her legs. But for seven months her family watched on as she was left frozen in her own body, unable to move, speak or even swallow as the illness - which affects only one in 50,000 people in the UK - took hold. She assumed partying during a stop over was the cause of her pain - but she had Guillain-Barre Syndrome . After returning from a flight she felt jet-lagged; her legs were heavy and she had pins and needles . Gemma was used to getting sore feet from partying in heels and never thought she might end up paralysed . Tests in October 2011 confirmed the diagnosis which led to Gemma first having to use crutches - and now a wheelchair. She spent seven months in the specialist Walton Neuro Rehabilitation Unit in Merseyside where she learned to talk, write and even partly walk again. Today, the aspiring model is taking part in a show called 'The Beauty Within' by Models of Diversity at London's Olympia. It is designed to show anyone can be beautiful, whatever their age, size or disability. Gemma said: 'People think sexy and disability don't go together, that you can't be sexy in a wheelchair, that you can't be glamorous, but I want to show that you can. 'It is more difficult because when you are walking you can maybe do a little dance but, in a wheelchair, you're a little more limited. After tests confirmed her diagnosis, Gemma spent months in the specialist Walton Neuro Rehabilitation Unit . 'But I'm looking forward to it - and I just hope I don't roll off the end!' Gemma will soon move to a bungalow with her boyfriend because she finds it increasingly difficult to get upstairs. And she admits having to use her wheelchair more frequently has previously left her in tears. She added: 'It's about seeing beyond the metal and the rubber, the wheelchair, to see the person behind it or in it.' Today, the aspiring model is taking part in a show called The Beauty Within, showing anyone can be beautiful . The aspiring model - seen here at the races - wants to show that you can be glamorous in a wheelchair . Gemma, pictured with the mobility scooter she sometimes uses to get around . 'Sometimes I do feel like I'm losing control but I have to try to stay positive and tell myself I have got through worse since my diagnosis. 'That's why I wanted to model in my chair. It's sticking two fingers up to things and saying you can do things, you just have to do things in a different way. 'It's about your personality, who you are inside. Doing the fashion show is saying ""this is me"".'","Gemma Flanagan, 31, from Liverpool, was hit by Guillain Barre Syndrome .
